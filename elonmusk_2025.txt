2025-05-24	Yes! 😍😍
2025-05-24	Imagine you need to drop off something on the other side of town  Instead of driving there yourself & wasting time in traffic, your car will be able to run that errand on its own, while you work or do other things.  On the way back, it could bring you your coffee order, without high delivery fees.  This will be possible in a Robotaxi future

2025-05-24	RT @JessePeltan: "solar uses too much land"  Does New York City use "too much" land?  Solar doesn't work because your favorite energy source uses less land than... a rooftop?

2025-05-03	How much of NYC would you need to cover in solar panels to turn it into a net exporter of electricity?  NYC uses about 50 TWh of electricity per year.  NYC has ~780 square kilometers of land area, and a GHI of 4 kWh/m^2/day, giving a primary solar resource of ~1,100 TWh/year - more than 20x electricity demand.  Let's assume we only place panels over existing impervious surfaces on buildings and parking lots. (the impervious part of the first 45.5%)  That brings our area to 261 sq km and our solar resource to 380 TWh/year.  With 23% efficient panels and 14% system losses (for dust, inverter losses, etc.) we get 75 TWh/year.  We would need to cover ~2/3 of the impervious surfaces in the "buildings & lots" category to generate as much electricity as NYC consumes.  This leaves open all existing sidewalks, streets, parks, vacant land, airports, etc. and doesn't include any vertical surfaces which could allow for capture of a larger fraction of NYC's primary solar resource.  The power density of solar PV is high enough to turn the densest city in the U.S. into an exporter of electricity.

2025-05-24	RT @MarioNawfal: 🇫🇯 STARLINK LINKS SIX FAR-OFF FIJI SCHOOLS  Deep in the South Pacific—basically the middle of nowhere—six super-remote schools in Fiji got Starlink’s high-speed internet!  Here’s the quick scoop:  • Starlink hooked up kids in nowhere-land with speedy Wi-Fi.  • STEM Surge Science and tech lessons got a major boost, no excuses.  • Virtual Vibes Online learning connects these remote classrooms—boom.  Nailing the global goal to connect all schools by 2030 puts Fiji’s on the map, literally!  Source: fijivillageCom

2025-05-24	STARLINK'S SKY DOMINANCE: ELON'S SATELLITES ARE EATING THE COMPETITION  Starlink has 7,300 satellites live, 5 million users, $12 billion revenue, and a full tank of rocket fuel. Elon owns the sky—literally.  Amazon’s Kuiper just launched its first 27 sats and will need up to $20 billion just to catch a whiff.   China’s racing with 26,000 on the board but can’t launch fast enough. EU’s IRIS² is stuck in bureaucracy.   Starlink's secret? Falcon 9’s raw speed, daily satellite output, and antennas that talk to space like it’s WiFi.   Everyone else is scrambling for backup plans.  Source: Financial Times
2025-05-24	RT @elonmusk: Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms.   I must be super focused on 𝕏/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.   As evidenced by the 𝕏 uptime issues this week, major operational improvements need to be made. The failover redundancy should have worked, but did not.
