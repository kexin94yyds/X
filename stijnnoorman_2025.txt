2025-06-29	You need to build leverage.  If you don't, you'll always trade time for money.  With leverage, you can earn with your mind instead.  Leverage allows you to get a bigger outcome with the same inputs.  You get a bigger return on your input if you push at the place with the green check (see image).  Business is the same.  Which is why we want to build leverage.  So followers and an email list.  The bigger it gets, the bigger your returns will get as well (without you having to do more).  It takes the same amount of effort to write an email to 100 or 100,000 people.  But the outcome will be 1000x bigger.  Do work that scales.  Earn with your mind, not your time.

2025-06-28	Read this if you're struggling with your offer:  Here's a mistake a lot of people make:  They think their product is their offer.  BUT IT ISN"T.  Your offer is the result that people want.  Your product is the thing that helps people get the result.  Example:  Your offer is a body transformation.  Your product is a diet and workout plan.  People don't want the diet and workout plan.  But they do want the body transformation.  So you sell them what they want.  And then you give them what they need to get what they want.  So back to your offer.  Offers are based on the outcome that you help people to achieve.  It needs to include:  ‚Ä¢ Person ‚Ä¢ Outcome ‚Ä¢ Timeframe ‚Ä¢ Steps to take ‚Ä¢ Guarantee (optional) ‚Ä¢ Required effort (time)  Then put a price tag on it that makes sense.  And you determine which type of offer you want to create:  ‚Ä¢ Done For You (DFY) - people pay you to do the work for them. ‚Ä¢ Done With You (DWY) - people pay you so you help them through the process. ‚Ä¢ Do It Yourself (DIY) - people pay you for your information so they can go through the process themselves.  All of them work well, and you can even have an offer for all 3.  I prefer DIY and DWY offers because they scale better (especially DIY offers, but more on that in a second).  But it's up to you.  Pick the one that seems like the most fun to you.  That's how you win long-term.

2025-06-27	I built an audience of 65,000+ followers across platforms.  Here's how to actually grow on X, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Threads:  You need to understand the Follower Funnel.  This is the process people go through from stranger to follower.  ‚Ä¢ People see your post or comment ‚Ä¢ If it's good, they click on your profile ‚Ä¢ If your profile is optimized, they hit follow  That's all.  One problem:  At the start, your tweets don't have organic reach yet.  So you need to leave comments.  A LOT of comments.  So make a list of 100 people in your niche.  Leave 50-100 quality comments per day.  This is how you force growth at the start.  If your profile is optimized, people will hit the follow button.  If your content is good, people will slowly start to consume it.  This is how you get the ball rolling.

2025-06-26	Want to gain more email subscribers?  Create a valuable lead magnet.  A lead magnet is a valuable solution to a small problem that your audience has.  Your lead magnet helps people from A to B.  Your offer helps them get to Z.  Example:  Lead magnet: get a girls phone number. Offer: go from getting a phone number to a high-quality relationship.  The lead magnet helps them to get a tiny result.  This increases their trust in you and it motivates them to take action.  To make a great lead magnet:  ‚Ä¢ You start with the goal ‚Ä¢ You identify the important topics ‚Ä¢ You write down the problems people face  Then you target one small problem and you make a valuable free product that solves it completely.  That's it.  Create a high-quality lead magnet and watch your email list grow.

Examples:  ‚Ä¢ Health: getting a sixpack ‚Ä¢ Wealth: making $5k/mo online ‚Ä¢ Relationships: getting a girlfriend  Identify the problems they need to solve and the skills that they need to develop.  Then make a product or service that helps people to solve these problems.  Show them how this can help them to achieve their desired outcome.  If you do this, you won't struggle with making money anymore.

2025-06-23	Read this if you're struggling with your 'niche'.  There are usually 2 camps when it comes to picking a niche.  1) The specialists.   They urge you to niche down as much as possible.   If you don't, you won't make money and you won't build authority according to them.   They prioritize money.  2) The generalists.   They tell you to write about whatever you want in whatever way you want to write about it.   They tell you everything will be alright no matter what you do.   They prioritize passion.  I've tried both approaches - and both failed me.  As a specialist, I made money but I hated the process.  As a generalist, I loved the process but made no money.  This led me to develop my own approach to it:  I call it the specialized generalist.  You specialize in one thing and you still talk about what you want.  But in a way that makes it interesting to other people.  This sounds a bit abstract, so let me clarify it with an example.  For this, you need to understand the Customer Journey.  This is the journey that your customer needs to go on to go from where they are to where they want to go to.  In my case, here are the things they need to learn for this (see image).  According to specialists, you should stick to these topics to build authority.  But here's what they miss:  People who want to grow and monetize their audience care about much more than just growth and business tips.  You could call business and writing the primary topics.  Because you need these to get the outcome.  But there are also tons of other topics that might be useful to people who want to build a one-person business.  For example:  ‚Ä¢ Fitness ‚Ä¢ Psychology ‚Ä¢ Emotional control  And many more.  We can call these your secondary topics.  These aren't required to build a business, but they will make it much easier to build a successful business.  So people who want to build a one-person business via social media will also be interested in these topics.  Because it helps them to achieve their goal(s).  And this is what makes it interesting to them.  So it's not so much about sticking to certain topics.  It's about showing people how your interests will help them to achieve their goals.  This is how you make your many interests interesting to others.  Niche down your offer.  Don't niche down your entire brand.  Write in a way that's interesting for your ideal reader.

2025-06-22	You need high-income skills to make it online.  Without them, you'll definitely fail.  But most people won't tell you what you actually need...  So here's what skills you ACTUALLY need:  I differentiate between 2 types of high-income skills:  1) Primary skills: skills you need to learn (can't be outsourced)  2) Secondary skills: skills you'll need (but can be outsourced).  It's ideal to have both but you have a limited amount of time.  So it's best to focus on the primary high-income skills first:  ‚Ä¢ Sales ‚Ä¢ Writing ‚Ä¢ Speaking ‚Ä¢ Marketing  You can build a business with just these skills.  ‚Ä¢ Sales helps to sell your offer and make money ‚Ä¢ Marketing helps to make people aware of your brand ‚Ä¢ Writing and speaking help to make high-quality content  These skills are required to build a one-person business.  So learning these should be your first priority.  If you combine these with your craft, you won't become a starving artist because you have what you need to make money as a creator.  But it's also useful to have the secondary high-income skills:  ‚Ä¢ AI use ‚Ä¢ Web design ‚Ä¢ Video editing ‚Ä¢ Graphic design  These skills are also very useful.  But they're secondary because you can build a successful one-person business without them.  And they're also easier to outsource.  You can hire a video editor or a freelancer to design your website.  But it's harder to outsource sales or writing.  Sure, you can hire a salesrep or ghostwriter.  But if you're starting out, this won't be realistic (because it's expensive and you consistently need to write and sell).  But you can make 6-figures (or even 7-figures) without a website or video content (if you can write, build, and sell well).  So that's why you want to learn those skills first.  Learning high-income skills is like learning to juggle.  Jugglers start with one ball.  Once they have good control over it, they add a second one.  High-income skills are the same.  I recommend starting with writing.  If you can write, you can create high-quality content, gain thousands of followers, and build your email list.  This puts you in the perfect position to learn the second high-income skill: selling.  Again, learn to write. Then learn to build and sell.  If you can do both, you'll be unstoppable.

2025-06-21	Success comes down to understanding this one thing:  The best (one-person) businesses have goals.  In order to achieve these goals, they need to:  ‚Ä¢ Do the right stuff ‚Ä¢ Do it in the right sequence ‚Ä¢ Do it for long enough to work  So in other words, you need the right inputs.  Because the right inputs lead to the right outcomes.  That's why your inputs are the most important thing to optimize in your business.  But that isn't all.  Just because something gets results doesn't mean that you enjoy it.  And if you're doing something that you hate just to get some outcome, you won't enjoy building your business and you'll eventually start to feel burned out.  Especially if you're a one-person business where you do (almost) all the work yourself.  So this is problematic.  To deal with this problem, I use the Noorman Matrix.  It's inspired by the Eisenhower Matrix.  The Eisenhower Matrix helps you to make decisions based on whether they're important and urgent.  The Noorman Matrix helps you to make decisions based on whether they're high-leverage and enjoyable.  The goal is to only do high-leverage activities and activities you enjoy.  Because you live the best life by optimizing the small stuff you do every day.  So if your day is filled with activities you enjoy, that also bring you closer toward your goals, you win.  This is how you can stay consistent for years or even decades.  And this consistency is what will give you the biggest returns because of compound interest.  So make a list of the stuff you're doing right now.  Ask yourself if it's high-leverage and if you enjoy it.  ‚Ä¢ If it's high-leverage and you enjoy it, do it. ‚Ä¢ If it's high-leverage and you hate it, outsource it. ‚Ä¢ If it's not high-leverage but you enjoy it, still do it. ‚Ä¢ If it's not high-leverage and you hate it, stop doing it.  Optimize your inputs for leverage and enjoyability.  Only do what you enjoy and what moves you closer to your goal.  This is how you enjoy the journey while you get to the destination.

2025-06-20	When I started creating, people told me I NEEDED to send a lot of DMs.  If I didn't, I would NEVER make money.  So I sent some DMs.  But it felt inauthentic.  I knew I had value to offer but it still felt like I was being a sleazy salesman.  It also barely gave me any results.  As with everything, it's a skill you can develop.  But it wasn't something that I wanted to learn.  Because here's how I think about it:  Whenever I buy something, it's because I like someone's writing.  ‚Ä¢ Tweets ‚Ä¢ E-mails ‚Ä¢ Articles  I consume their content first.  And if I like it, I look at their products and services to see if they can help me.  I've never bought from someone who cold DM'ed me.  And most people I know are the same.  Cold DMs repel them.  So I went all-in on writing content instead.  This removed a lot of inner resistance.  I no longer felt like I was selling to people.  I was simply writing the best tweets and emails I could.  This attracted people who actually resonated with my message. ‚Äã It may not be 'the best way' to get clients.  Because there is no best way.  But it is the best way for me.  It feels authentic and I enjoy it.  And since I've done this I've more than doubled my income.  So stop listening to gurus.  Find the business model that works best FOR YOU.

Because all you need to make money is:  1) Something to sell  2) People to sell to  If you have a skill, you already have something to sell.  It's just a matter of turning it into an offer so that it's clear to people how you can help them.  After that, it's just a matter of putting it in front of the right people.  Aka your audience.  People pay money to solve their problems so they can get what they want.  So ...  ‚Ä¢ Figure out what they want ‚Ä¢ Figure out how to get it yourself ‚Ä¢ Figure out how to help them get it  That's how you win.

2025-06-18	Social media is simple.  ‚Ä¢ Grab attention ‚Ä¢ Keep attention ‚Ä¢ Convert attention  This is how you turn ideas into income.  However, most people leak traffic.  As a result they gain less of the things they want.  ‚Ä¢ Followers ‚Ä¢ Email subs ‚Ä¢ Customers/clients  They're not making huge mistakes.  But there are a few things they're overlooking.  It's like pouring water into a funnel that has a few holes in it.  You'll waste a lot of the water that's coming in.  And a lot of creators I see have the same problem.  Their profile, content, emails, and offers leak traffic.  This is why they miss out on a lot of followers, email subs, and clients.  The good news is that this is quite easy to fix.  You just need to know where to close the gaps.  Once you do, you'll almost instantly stop the leaking.  The biggest leaks are:  ‚Ä¢ Posts ‚Ä¢ Emails ‚Ä¢ Offers  Once you fix these, you have everything you need to add $10k/mo and 10,000 followers.  ‚Ä¢ If you write better posts, you get more followers ‚Ä¢ If you write better emails, you make more sales ‚Ä¢ If you write better offers, you make more money  All 3 of these things can be isolated and improved.  You just need to know the right inputs.  When you do, you'll stop leaking money.

2025-06-17	I was in a nut store yesterday.  And while I was standing there I had an important insight about selling offers.  You see, the nut store had tons of different boxes.  And they basically gave you 2 choices:  1) Buy nuts of one type 2) Buy different combinations of nuts  This makes sense because not everyone wants only 1 type of nuts.  And when you combine different types of nuts, certain people get interested.  Selling your offers is the same.  If you only have 1 big offer that contains everything, only a small portion of your audience will be interested.  But if you break it up into different parts, some people will be interested.  And if you combine these parts into something new, some more people will be interested.  So in this way, you can sell to a much higher percentage of your audience.  All you need to do is change the packaging.  Instead of only selling a combination of all nuts, you can sell them per type or you can create new different combinations.  This makes it feel new and it creates more customers.  Because some customers only have 1 problem they want help with.  The cool part is that this doesn't have to cost you a lot of extra time.  You can simply break off parts of your big offer and turn them into smaller offers.  You can sell these offers to make money and you can also use them to turn low-ticket customers into high-ticket clients.  I call this Strategic Selling.  You break up your big offer into multiple smaller offers.  It gives people the chance to try out your stuff.  And it helps to make more money by offering people a specific small solution to a problem.  Best of all, it barely takes any more time for you.  But it does make a lot more money.  Win-win for your and your audience.

2025-06-16	When your offers don't sell, it's because of one of 3 reasons:  ‚Ä¢ People can't afford it ‚Ä¢ People don't find it desirable ‚Ä¢ People don't trust you enough  And usually, reason 1 and 2 aren't the case.  Because most offers are less than $2000.  So if people truly see the value in it, they'll find a way to buy it.  Most offers also give a desirable outcome ($5k-$10k/mo etc.).  So the outcome also isn't the problem.  The problem is that people don't believe you can deliver.  This problem exists because most people only have an expensive high-ticket offer.  They don't sell anything cheaper.  They rationalize it with 'high-ticket makes more money'.  And they're right about that.  But the point of having lower ticket offers isn't to make a ton of money.  It's to give people a chance to try out your stuff.  Only having an expensive high-ticket offer is liking asking people to get into a relationship with you before going on a date.  Unless you(r offer) look(s) really good, most people won't do it.   Having smaller offers gives people the chance to go on a date with you first.  And if they like it, they have the option to continue working with you.  Most people underestimate the power of this.  80% of my clients already bought something else from me before they became a client.  They liked the cheaper product and they needed more help, so they became clients.  This funnel also reduces a lot of friction.  You don't have to sell people on your high-ticket offer.  You simply make a valuable smaller offer and you explain how they can get more help if they liked it.  Less frustration and more money.  Win-win for you and your audience.

2025-06-14	The best brands don‚Äôt market.   They connect on a deeper level.  How?  They stand for something deeper.  Or more precisely - they embody an archetype.  Carl Jung called archetypes:   "Primitive mental images inherited from the earliest human ancestors, and supposed to be present in the collective unconscious."  In simpler words:  It's how people perceive you(r brand).  The right archetype can transform your brand.  Here they are with examples:  üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Magician ‚Äì Makes dreams real (Disney) ü¶∏ Hero ‚Äì Inspires action and mastery (Nike) ‚ù§Ô∏è Lover ‚Äì Evokes intimacy and indulgence (Godiva) üé≠ Jester ‚Äì Adds humor and fun (Old Spice) üë´ Everyman ‚Äì Relatable and down-to-earth (IKEA) üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Caregiver ‚Äì Nurtures and protects (UNICEF) üëë Ruler ‚Äì Brings order and control (Hugo Boss) üé® Creator ‚Äì Fosters innovation and originality (Apple) üòá Innocent ‚Äì Radiates optimism and purity (Dove) üß† Sage ‚Äì Shares wisdom and truth (BBC) üß≠ Explorer ‚Äì Craves discovery and freedom (The North Face) üî• Outlaw ‚Äì Disrupts the norm (Harley-Davidson)  Each one fulfills a core human desire ‚Äî like safety, freedom, connection, or power.  Your job?  Pick one.  Double down.  Let your content, visuals, and message reflect it consistently.  Brands that feel like people are the ones we trust.  Archetypes make that possible.  Pick yours to connect with your audience on a deeper level.

And mental energy is a limited source.  ‚Ä¢ Every extra task on your to-do-list takes up some space. ‚Ä¢ Every extra item on your desk takes up some space. ‚Ä¢ Every extra tab you open takes up some space.  So you need to be mindful of what you do and don't do.

2025-06-06	If you understand this image, you understand how to sell.  Let me explain.  People buy certain outcomes.  ‚Ä¢ They want a better body, so they buy a fitness program ‚Ä¢ They want a relationship, so they buy a dating program ‚Ä¢ They want freedom, so they buy a business program  They buy because they want a certain transformation.  In other words, they want to get from A to B.  A is where they are right now.  B is where they want to get to.  But they don't know how to get to B by themselves.  Because there are certain obstacles standing in the way.  This is where you come in.  You make money by helping people solve problems so they can get their desired outcome.  This is what the image above shows you.  ‚Ä¢ The A to B illustrates the customer journey ‚Ä¢ The red crosses illustrate the problems they'll encounter ‚Ä¢ The boxes illustrate the high-ticket, mid-ticket, and low-ticket offers you can make by solving certain problems  It's all about helping people make a certain transformation.  And once you've created your solution for this, you can break it up into smaller solutions to specific problems.  This helps you get more customers and if you set it up right, you can turn these customers into clients on autopilot.  Which makes you a lot more money.

2025-06-05	I was in a nut store yesterday.  And while I was standing there I had an important insight about selling offers.  You see, the nut store had tons of different boxes.  And they basically gave you 2 choices:  1) Buy nuts of one type 2) Buy different combinations of nuts  This makes sense because not everyone wants only 1 type of nuts.  And when you combine different types of nuts, certain people get interested.  Selling your offers is the same.  If you only have 1 big offer that contains everything, only a small portion of your audience will be interested.  But if you break it up into different parts, some people will be interested.  And if you combine these parts into something new, some more people will be interested.  So in this way, you can sell to a much higher percentage of your audience.  All you need to do is change the packaging.  Instead of only selling a combination of all nuts, you can sell them per type or you can create new different combinations.  This makes it feel new and it creates more customers.  Because some customers only have 1 problem they want help with.  The cool part is that this doesn't have to cost you a lot of extra time.  You can simply break off parts of your big offer and turn them into smaller offers.  You can sell these offers to make money and you can also use them to turn low-ticket customers into high-ticket clients.  I call this Strategic Selling.  You break up your big offer into multiple smaller offers.  It gives people the chance to try out your stuff.  And it helps to make more money by offering people a specific small solution to a problem.  Best of all, it barely takes any more time for you.  But it does make a lot more money.  Win-win for your and your audience.

2025-06-04	When your offers don't sell, it's because of one of 3 reasons:  ‚Ä¢ People can't afford it ‚Ä¢ People don't find it desirable ‚Ä¢ People don't trust you enough  And usually, reason 1 and 2 aren't the case.  Because most offers are less than $2000.  So if people truly see the value in it, they'll find a way to buy it.  Most offers also give a desirable outcome ($5k-$10k/mo etc.).  So the outcome also isn't the problem.  The problem is that people don't believe you can deliver.  This problem exists because most people only have an expensive high-ticket offer.  They don't sell anything cheaper.  They rationalize it with 'high-ticket makes more money'.  And they're right about that.  But the point of having lower ticket offers isn't to make a ton of money.  It's to give people a chance to try out your stuff.  Only having an expensive high-ticket offer is liking asking people to get into a relationship with you before going on a date.  Unless you(r offer) look(s) really good, most people won't do it.   Having smaller offers gives people the chance to go on a date with you first.  And if they like it, they have the option to continue working with you.  Most people underestimate the power of this.  80% of my clients already bought something else from me before they became a client.  They liked the cheaper product and they needed more help, so they became clients.  This funnel also reduces a lot of friction.  You don't have to sell people on your high-ticket offer.  You simply make a valuable smaller offer and you explain how they can get more help if they liked it.  Less frustration and more money.  Win-win for you and your audience.

2025-06-03	99% of personal brands look the same.  The best creators find a way to stand out.  I‚Äôve created the term Brand Ikigai to help you do this.  It‚Äôs based on the Japanese concept of Ikigai.  Your Ikigai is your ‚Äòreason for being.‚Äô  It‚Äôs what brings you joy and inspires you to get out of bed every day.  Your Brand Ikigai is your ‚Äòreason for brand.‚Äô  It‚Äôs your brand's purpose that excites you and helps and inspires your audience.  For some people this is niching down and making a lot of money.  This is fine.  I want to make a lot of money too.  But I also want to explore my curiosity while I‚Äôm doing it.  This is what gives me a sense of meaning.  It‚Äôs what excites me when I think of building my brand.  You have to determine for yourself what you want your brand to be.  Don't let some guru guilt you into thinking your brand needs to be a certain way.  Think about:  ‚Ä¢ Topics: These are your interests and passions. ‚Ä¢ Skills: These are the valuable skills you‚Äôve learned. ‚Ä¢ Purpose: This is the bigger picture that your brand helps with. ‚Ä¢ Transformation: The change or value you bring to your audience.  Your Brand Ikigai is at the intersection.  It‚Äôs what‚Äôs truly authentic to you.  You can use it to monetize and explore your curiosity.  And it works whether you niche down or not.  It‚Äôs how your topics and skills give your audience the transformation that gives them the purpose.  For me, it‚Äôs how self-improvement, online business, and content creation help you build a solo business so you can live a free and meaningful life on your own terms.  Niche down your transformation, not your entire brand.

2025-05-23	I recently read The Art Of War by Sun Tzu.  It's a book about war strategies.  But most of them apply perfectly to business as well.  There was one strategy that perfectly explains why you should do less.  You see, when you‚Äôre on the battlefield you have a limited amount of soldiers.  It's about using these soldiers in the right place.  So you concentrate your forces in order to force a breakthrough in 1 area.  At their weakest point.  This gives you the best chance to force a breakthrough.  And this applies perfectly to getting things done.  Many people think it‚Äôs best to do as much as possible.  But the counterintuitive thing is that you actually get more done by doing less.  Or more preciously - doing less better.  Just like an army, you have a limited amount of attacking power.  So the more problems you attack, the less strength you have for each of them.  So if you want to get a lot done, it‚Äôs best to focus on the highest leverage activity.  In other words: you need to attack your problems at their weakest and most effective point to get the most done.  And you can only do this if you concentrate your forces.  So doing a lot may seem productive.  But using all your forces for 1 problem is actually the more productive move.  You don't need to do more.  You need to optimize less.  So think like a war strategist and take out the most important problem at its weakest point.  That's how you get the most done.  It's also how you get the best results with writing.  Don't make your writing long and complex.  Make it short and to the point.

2025-05-22	You're closer to freedom than you think.  To make $5,000/mo, you need:  ‚Ä¢ 3 HT clients (3 x $1,000 = $3,000)  ‚Ä¢ 10 course sales (10 x $100 = $1,000) ‚Ä¢ 10 workshop sales (10 x $100 = $1,000)  That's pretty achievable, right?  If you dislike courses or workshops you can replace them.  For $10,000/mo, we can simply double the numbers:  ‚Ä¢ 6 HT clients (6 x $1,000 = $6,000/mo)  ‚Ä¢ 20 course sales (20 x $100 = $2,000/mo) ‚Ä¢ 20 workshop sales (20 x $100 = $2,000/mo)  This is within your grasp.  I'm not saying you'll achieve this tomorrow if you're just starting out.  But you can definitely achieve this within 6-12 months.  All you need is 2h per day and a system that works.  Create an offer, write competence content, and write emails.  Your future self will thank you.

2025-05-21	Writing is simple.  But not easy.  It's the art of grabbing and keeping attention.  And in some cases converting that attention.  These are the first-principles.  So these are the things we should keep in mind when we write.  We should constantly ask ourselves this:  "Would I keep reading?"  If yes, good.  If no, edit it.  Good writing makes people wonder about what comes next.  I calls this a Logical Chain.  Sentence A should lead into sentence B.  Sentence B should lead into sentence C.  Etc.  A simple example:  "Your thoughts change your actions.  Your actions change your outcomes."  The end of sentence A naturally leads into sentence B.  This is just one example.  In long-form writing, this works as well.  But not necessarily with the same words.  ‚Ä¢ Sentence A leads to sentence B ‚Ä¢ Sentence B leads to sentence C ‚Ä¢ Sentence C leads to sentence D  Etc.  People keep reading if they want to find out what comes next.  Logical chains help you to do just that.  Start using logical chains.
