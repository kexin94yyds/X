2025-09-23	RT @VivaLaPanda: One day a student moved to SF. He went to his Master and asked, "Teacher, I am new here and understand that SF is a city of many freedoms. What musnt I do?"  The teacher replied simply: "everything is permitted"  Hearing this, the student went into the city.  Growing weary from walking, the student stops to rest on a swing. Before he can sit down, the police come and remove the swing.  Filled with indignity, the student returns to his teacher and asks: "teacher, why did the police remove this thing which harmed no soul?"  His teacher replied simply: "everything is permitted"  At that moment, the student was enlightened

2025-09-07	RT @arjunkhemani: .@naval: “I’m deeply suspicious of groups of people coming to the truth in anything.   It’s not to say groups are bad. Humans are cooperators by nature. We need groups to get things done.  But groups need consensus. A group that does not have consensus will fall apart.  A group will not admit its mistakes. It will not admit that it was wrong. It will not pivot. It’s not a truth-seeking entity.  Individuals can seek truth, and then based on that, they can choose to cooperate with others for limited periods of time to effectuate that truth, or to have something come out of it.  But if you’re really looking for truth, it’s the opposite of looking for social approval.  Truth requires feedback. It requires error correction.”

2025-09-07	A government is the “biggest gang,” with a local monopoly on violence.   It’s good at preventing and stopping things.  It’s bad at building and running things.  Its main job is law and order, and a government which fails at that, is a failed government.
2025-09-06	AIs aren’t minds and robots aren’t bodies.   They’re better at some things - usually the things we hate to do.  They’re worse at other things - usually the things we like to do.  Automation more than competition.
2025-09-05	Starting a company is solving a simultaneous equation - you’re convincing the money that you have the talent, and the talent that you have the money.
2025-09-05	The purest reason to make something is not to make money and not even to make the thing.   It’s to have the experience of making the thing - and no one can take that from you.

2025-09-04	RT @naval: @sriramk My “formula.” • Write down something that you experientially, deeply know to be true and was not obvious to you earlier. • Remove every extra word. Use simple words. • Ignore how your followers may react. Never write for the audience.
