2025-05-27	Most people I know who became successful had a main job going and then they made one or many side projects  Then one took off and when that side project made more money than the main job and was stable (like 6 months) they quit the main job  I've only once seen anyone succeed on savings with limited runway and that was @AndreyAzimov but he's the most hardcore guy I know and Ukrainian, so a different breed  You're probably not like him so don't quit your main job  You won't "have more time", the fact you think "I don't have enoug time" is just procrastination for you not shipping, time is just about setting priorities, there's always a few minutes spread over the day you can ship  No excuses!

2025-05-27	Sunflower oil is just another seed oil and terrible for you:  Heat unstable, oxidizes fast, full of omega-6 (linoleic acid, aka the bad omega), refined using chemical solvents, linked to heart disease, inflammation and possibly cancer  Ask @grok if you don't believe me! https://t.co/IyMgNb8vsS
2025-05-27	@levelsio Sunflower oil also tastes great and is a lot better for cooking.

2025-05-27	375°F = 190°C  That's not insanely hot for cooking  A steak is cooked at max heat, that's 200-250°C = 390°F-480°F!
2025-05-27	@AdonisOnX @levelsio It really depends how insanely hot you cook your food, 375 is HOT!
2025-05-27	Butter is nice but worse to cook with than olive oil  It burns faster  Smoke point: - Butter: 150°C / 300°F - Olive oil: 200°C / 400°F - Beef tallow: 230°C / 420–450°F - Ghee (clarified butter): 260°C / 500°F
2025-05-27	@levelsio How about butter? That has an even lower max temperature than olive oil, and it does the job perfectly fine?
2025-05-27	You HAVE to cook steak at high heat
2025-05-27	@levelsio There is no need to cook at high heat. I’ve been using Olive oil to cook for the last 5-6 years and it works perfectly fine. Unless you’re somehow in a hurry to finish cooking your dish in 2m.
2025-05-27	Olive oil is great for salads  You should absolutely NOT cook with it at high heat though because it's not heat-stable at all and has a low smoke point  Olive oil burns quite quickly, oxidizes, breaks down and then becomes almost just as bad as seed oils  Beef tallow or ghee is very heat stable and won't oxidize easily!
2025-05-27	@levelsio With virgin olive oil available I don't understand why you go with butter.   Even more heresy if you live in Portugal which is next to Spain == big quantities of "liquid gold"
2025-05-27	🛢️I think generally good to shy away completely from any seed oils for your health  Even if the evidence is not completely conclusive, better safe than sorry (same with microplastics etc)  I cook solely in butter, clarified butter (ghee), beef tallow (which is cow fat)  Even found a nice beef tallow spray in US at Whole Foods actually, but we also have beef tallow from the local butcher here  (not affiliated just like the product)

2025-05-25	Every time I say Portugal is an amazing country but absolutely nothing here functions properly I catch so much flack and blame for it  And especially Portuguese people will blame and it's all because of me, myself and I  Now you have the CEO of a $50B company @Cloudflare  saying it too  The government here simply doesn't function at any level, courts are extremely slow, running a business here is practically impossible and there's a perpetual shortage of people because nobody actually wants to work (you can get easily get €500/mo benefits here, so why work for a €750/mo minimum wage, only €250 more but you have to work :D)  Meanwhile the young, ambitious and high IQ leave the country at age 18 because no opportunities  The weather is absolutely perfect though, air quality cleanest in the world, the most beautiful sunsets, people are generally nice (outside of the service industry), the fresh food is actually good  And Portugal has the opportunity of a lifetime, everyone in tech wants to move here and move their company along with it, and that could be a massive contribution to the economy creating high tech jobs, and elevate the population  But it just feels they prefer to actively waste that opportunity
2025-05-25	Honestly: across the board, Portugal has gotten significantly WORSE since we started making investments in the country. If the trend continues, we’ll stop investing. And if you’re considering it as a tech firm, you’d be crazy to without some hard reassurances from the government.

Not only that, they can’t even provide some official document stating your residency is valid even though it has officially expired.  So your expired resident card is your problem and it’s your responsibility to explain to airlines and various border authorities that well, yes, it’s expired but the government says it’s still valid till they figure out how to renew.

2025-05-25	If there was enough housing supply this wouldn't matter though  Are we attacking investors in coffee for making coffee more expensive?  Not really  Generally investors are a scapegoat, as are digital nomads, and foreigners, and immigrants, etc  Always somebody  But you know you can just increase the housing supply and you wouldn't need a scapegoat anymore!
2025-05-25	@levelsio people buy houses to park cash too not only to live in them and that props up demand
2025-05-25	Land is scarce precisely because municipalities and governments keep it scarce  Land is zoned for residential, commercial, rural, farming, nature etc. depending on how countries structure this around the world  In Portugal for example there's urbano (buildable) and rustico (non-buildable) land  It's up to government to make more land legal to build upon, cities do this all the time btw: because cities expand and grow  But home owners don't wanna lose their investment, and so they elect politicians who maintain that path  A lot of not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) anti-building sentiment is based on eco reasons too: "we have to preserve nature" etc. Fair, but the real reason is protecting investment  Politicians generally can't help reduce or even stagnate prices by building more, they'd get elected (more like ejected) out of office  That is until the problem of not being able to buy or rent becomes untenable for most of the population  Which is soon I think
2025-05-25	I usually don't have the experience to comment on a lot of things you post Pieter, but this is uniquely in my wheel house given what I'm building at Lofty.  So, real estate in general have been appreciating in most places over the last few decades. But people don't realize that real estate involves two components, the actual structure (house, building, etc) and the physical land.  In reality, the actual structure is depreciating over the years, because it gets used, becomes worn, interior is outdated.  But if the land is an a desirable area, with population growth, its value is what's actually increasing. And when you can sell the property for a higher value in the future, it's basically the market affirming that the land has grown more in value, than your structure has decreased in value.  This makes sense, because land in general is scarce. For example, literally everyone wants to live somewhere that has moderate weather, good food and culture, walkable streets, safe, and great schools for their kids. But if you had to guess how many actual neighborhoods in the world have all of these features, what do you think the number would be? Probably pretty low percentage wise, yet everyone on earth would like to live in this relatively small percentage of land.  As a result, the supply is usually constrained, while demand is increasing (if population is growing and GDP is growing, because it means a higher portion of people who have enough money to buy into these desirable neighborhoods). The usual outcome of slow supply growth, but higher demand growth, is increases in value, but that increase is for the land, not actually for the building.  On another note, I also see a lot of people complaining about how it's unfair their boomer relatives bought property for $30,000 and now it's worth $1,000,000. The fact they're ignoring is that those same boomers didn't always buy in the most desirable neighborhoods with the largest houses when they were in their 20s/30s. Many of them too a gamble, either betting on the future or because they had no choice, to buy in a less than desirable neighborhood, often further away from established cities and infrastructure. But, over time, those areas experienced growth and increased demand and transformed into desirable neighborhoods, which is why those properties are now worth millions.  There are quite literally a huge amount of supply of housing in the USA that cost below $200k, affordable for many millennials and gen z folks, but because they don't already have all the nice amenities, people don't want to move there. They all want to live in Beverly Hills, but insist that it should be affordable for a 20 year old.

2025-05-25	In my birth country the Netherlands a funny thing is happening  For the last 5 years the government has been trying to stop people from building new homes  Because they measured too much nitrogen in the air  They're also trying to close down farms  It's a dense country with a massive housing crisis and it's the 2nd biggest agricultural exporter in the world  Making sure nobody young in the Netherlands can afford to buy or rent a home and then killing your biggest industry is a sure fire way to nuke your economy our of existence  You'll ask "why?"  Well it's because of the eco mindvirus, nitrogen emissions are bad for climate change etc.  Even if that's true, you don't self-sabotage your country like that if you're sane  Many Dutch leave elsewhere now  Similar simply non-sane things happening all over Europe now

2025-05-25	True, of course it is good to preserve nature  But there's a lot of land available to grow cities, a lot of it is zoned for rural  There's a massive housing shortage and young people can't afford buying a home in most of the world  Do you think that's optimal?  But at least we have nature right?  Should they sleep in tents in nature?
2025-05-25	@levelsio Mate, it is important to protect nature and agriculture. Saying every land should be buildable is a stance that doesn’t check other arguments and other needs

2025-05-25	@levelsio And on foreign buyers again obviously it effects demand, its just a question of how much. New Zealand banned foreign ownership of houses due to it effecting their market a lot. Now u can be politically against it, but characterising it as scapegoating is wrong imo. They r factors

They say "its permanent protection is essential for climate resilient communities and a thriving local economy"  But what they really mean is if we allow more houses, the house prices in the horseshoe wont be so golden anymore.  Relative to income (both average but also high paying bank jobs), Toronto is more expensive than San Francisco or New York.

2025-05-25	You'll only fix this when politicians grow the balls to tell the homeowner class that they'll just have to suck it up that their house will become worth a little less while we rapidly try to expand the supply.  It's the only fucking explanation why time and time again these fuckers only ever want to do shit on the 'demand' side.

2025-05-25	@levelsio yes and no, i agree with your point and intention.  but wealth also grows, more and more people are lifted into the middle class. luxury is wanted by a growing number of people. similarly hotspots will attract more wealth and outpace other areas.
2025-05-25	Opposite?  Houses only getting smaller  My parents had a big house, kitchen, TV room, dining room, big garden, multiple bedrooms  Most of my friends now have a 1 bedroom kitchen combo living room $1500/mo apartment

It's governments blocking it  Of course sometimes for good reason, like preserve nature  Often it's more to preserve house prices though 🤓

2025-05-25	@Austen @levelsio Down town land may bc of demand but if we have one thing here is land categorized as "rural, can't build shit", and municipalities could change that with a law but don't because then their wealth evaporates
2025-05-25	Land supply isn't fixed at all  Most governments own shitload of land that they can instantly sell and allow to be build on  Also a lot of land not owned by them is regulated NOT to be build upon  How do you think cities grow? They expand into rural land by making it buildable  There's more than enough land but it's regulated to not be used now because it's politically beneficial to pump house prices for home ownere
2025-05-25	@levelsio Not to say that there isn't some truth to this, but isn't the bigger factor that most of the value of a house comes from the land its built on?   We can't make more land (supply is fixed), and the world population is increasing (more demand), so the value of land always goes up.
2025-05-25	inb4 "but companies, stocks, S&amp;P500 go up?"  Yes because companies expand their market, increase prices, create new products  My house does absolutely nothing, it just sits there and slowly falls apart  Why should the price go up?! It should be going down?
2025-05-25	It's funny, if you buy a: - car - furniture - machinery - laptop - washing machine - oven - most things really  You expect it to depreciate and lose value, because why wouldn't it?  But when buying houses, the banks and government created this artificial system where they NEED house prices to always go up to make it a good investment for people  And people get elected for keeping this system, or else social revolt would start  This entire system relies on a perpetual housing shortage  Which is why most people now can't afford to buy a house and many can't even afford to rent  No politician is gonna risk changing that because it'd probably be a career ender, that is until the people that can NOT afford a home become powerful enough to elect some revolutionary politician into power

2025-05-15	📈 New record MRR and record low churn on Photo AI  AI models keep improving which is the main thing, for example now creating a new model of a person takes 3 minutes instead of 2 hours! Users really like to NOT wait I think  I also added single top up credits a few months ago, which stops people churning even if they're out of credits (before they'd be forced to upgrade to a higher plan)  And last week added daily emails for customers who fail their renewal payment, once they pay that last invoice, Stripe saves the updated payment method and they are "recovered" customers which in turns reduces churn. I know @Stripe sends these emails too, but they're less personal and less branded than my own text-only emails which is a bit more stern:  "Your last payment for Photo AI failed. To continue using Photo AI, keep your content and avoid service interruption, please pay your last invoice by clicking the link below and then clicking [ Pay invoice ]:  https:// photoai .com/pay?hash=  All your AI models, photos, videos and all saved content will be permanently deleted if your account remains unpaid. Please pay your last invoice as soon as possible to avoid losing your content and account access."  I also increased the recovery try time in Stripe from 1 week to 4 weeks with 8 smart retries  One other thing I'd like to try is a tip by @loaibassam to send reactivation emails, so I make a daily cron robot that sends 100 emails to old customers that churned and ask them to come back, tell them how Photo AI improved since they left, and offer a discount to sign up again, I have tens of thousands of old customers to send that to  It's always hard to say WHAT causes MRR to go up and churn to go down but something is working!

2025-05-22	I solely wear Alo Yoga shorts, they're soft, light weight, and just nice  But they're made of polyester  I've tried a lot of 100% cotton shorts, they're generally NOT soft, they're very heavy, and they're just not comfortable to wear  But now Alo has come out with new shorts that don't have polyester, and they're also not heavy: they're 47% Modal, 47% Cotton, 6% Elastane  What's Modal?  "Modal is made from beech tree pulp, which is a renewable resource used to produce modal fabric, a semi-synthetic textile known for its softness, breathability, and eco-friendly properties. The process involves harvesting beech trees, extracting cellulose from the wood pulp, and then chemically processing it to create the modal fibers. Modal is a form of rayon, but it is slightly more durable and flexible and requires fewer harsh chemicals in its production process. "  Obviously it's still semi-synthetic, but I think/hope it's better for my balls!  For women there's also Modal leggings coming out now!
2024-08-08	Someone needs to invent cotton yoga shorts/leggings  Cause rn they are polyester and leak microplastics into the most high absorption area: genitals  That ends up disrupting the hormonal system and can cause infertility  Should be priority for a society fighting low birth rates! https://t.co/Uzo2T0ij5S

2025-05-21	It's interesting to see the "hold-outs" against AI slowly come to the other side and get AI-pilled  Many people didn't see the point, had bad first experiences and then thought "it's all hype bs"  Then the models get better, they try a few more times and they get it
2025-05-21	My mind changed re: programming with AI as soon as I realized how much of the stuff I do when "programming" is just tedious grunt work.  Programming with AI actually frees me up to do more programming, not less. https://t.co/mZdbJ9BMdB

2025-05-18	okay @levelsio, i’ve got something that might interest you!  The problem didn't come from CP437 encoding. It's a problem of tokenizer/model pair. I'm guessing you took the 'tokenize.bin' from the releases/ folder but this one is the wrong one. Make sure to download the tok512.bin from tinyllamas and use that instead (rename it to tokenize.bin too). As you can see in my screenshots, it fixed the gibberish problem!  https://t.co/hwRTeFa7CA

2025-05-21	✨ This week I visited my API provider @FAL in San Francisco  It's funny to go visit the ACTUAL physical place where you send tens of thousands of CURL requests to every day (well kinda cause they host stuff not in the office of course)  FAL is responsible for hosting ALL the AI models I use for my site Photo AI and keeping those stable, affordable and most of all VERY fast  My site Photo AI now produces over 1 million photos per month (and some videos), and every single one of those goes through FAL's infrastructure  They take the work of setting up servers with GPUs and managing them out of my hands, and on top of that for a very affordable rate so it'd be more expensive for me to do it myself  I discovered FAL the first time because they were somehow able to run a lot of the models I used (back then Stable Diffusion) ridiculously fast: where before it'd take me 45 seconds to generate a finetuned AI photo (meaning a photo of an actual person), with FAL it'd take 3 seconds! So about 10-15x faster! Insane  Their whole edge is speed and they do everything they can to optimize AI models to run faster, and it's economically smart for them too: they often charge the same $ per megapixel, so if they are able to run things faster, it costs them less GPU time, so less $ spent for them, but they can charge the same $ = more profit (but usually they then make it cheaper for me too)  One of the coolest things they did recently is built a superfast Flux trainer that runs in just 30 seconds, and at high quality. This means when users sign up to my site Photo AI, they upload their photos, and a few minutes later they're already taking AI photos of themselves  They're also really stable though and that's important. If FAL goes down, Photo AI goes down, and customers get very angry. Imagine people signing up and paying, and it doesn't work. I get about 30 new customers per day and have 2000+ active customers, if it goes down people get very angry, very fast. Luckily FAL literally almost never goes down!  I was kinda shocked how lean they are when visiting their office, it's just about 20 employees but they have a big impact, and big enterprise customers like Adobe signing up. Obviously each employee is very impactful for them to be able to run it like this. Very impressive and indie in a way  I heard it's good to align yourself with your API providers you rely on, so I've also invested in them now a bit!  They took us out for 🥟 Dim Sum and what surprised me was how international they were, it's 2 🇹🇷Turkish founders (ex-Coinbase and Amazon), and then they have people from Brazil, Venezuela, China, Bulgaria. They're in America but it's actually barely American. Maybe obvious but Silicon Valley really doesn't care where you're from or how you look, it's only about what your skills are and how you can contribute  I think the next thing for AI now is video (yesterday Veo 3 came out for example, a groundbreaking video model with speech dialogue). AI companies now are trying to enter Hollywood to try sell the promise of AI video to them which can save them a lot of money vs. recording actual footage. FAL is a provider for those video models so can provide those big media companies with affordable and reliable AI model hosting. In a way they're just addressing a tiny part of the market now with people like me, when the big market is all the companies that produce image/video content.  So yes go meet your API providers! You'll discover there's actually people behind the API endpoint! 😂

2025-05-18	From the perspective of a third party supplier what you do is:  Bid at contracts of high quality brands with an excellent sales team  Bid the absolutely lowest price while giving big promises  Do a good job for the first few months then slowly start cutting costs and quality to the lowest possible while still legally adhering to your contract  You do this by hiring the cheapest people possible, running them to the ground, causing high churn of staff and both customers and the workers getting a terrible experience  The beneficiaries here are the owners of the businesses that get higher profit margins short term  Long term this destroys brands because you stop perceiving them as high quality  Or does it...  Because one interesting addition to this is the giant industry of fake reviews that has spun up where every place now is easily able to buy a 4.5/5 on Google Maps etc  So even if quality is guaranteed to go to shit, customers will complain but they'll get drowned out by fake positive reviews and it won't affect the brand  That's why many of us have this sneaking suspicion that there's been collective enshittification post-COVID but none of us can conclusively prove it  This is what's happening I think
2025-05-18	Yesterday we went to the pool, there was no staff present, just a girl who was highly uninterested  So then we wanted to go swim but a family had brought their dog to swim in the pool 😂  So we spoke to staff, turns out this 5-star hotel has outsourced everything to other companies: - the entire pool and spa is ran by a different company - the entire cleaning service is ran by a different company - the entire in-room dining is ran by a different company  Essentially the hotel itself ONLY runs the front desk and pays the hotel brand for a license, EVERYTHING ELSE is outsourced!  So there's no way to maintain quality here cause they've outsourced everything to the cheapest bidders  Similar story to many US airlines, who outsourced all their repairs/mechanics to the cheapest bidders and now have more issues  Now I think we're getting closer to figuring out the source of the collective enshittification, it's managers outsourcing everything to get costs down, but there's no way to maintain quality this way  Same story with car companies. There was this video by the Ford CEO here who said they couldn't make any changes to their car's features because they have 150 suppliers that all do something specific (like the car seat control, the dashboard, the media system, the breaking system). They do almost nothing in-house anymore!  Which is why you see some brands return to full in-house, like Elon Musk tries to build everything in-house with Tesla, Starlink and SpaceX. Only way to control quality is control the full experience  Now at least we know how to solve the enshittification  VERY interesting

My streak rule was to work out at least 15 minutes a day, but even on sick days, it was always at least 30min. Average sweat time is usually about 45min-1h per day, on good days I do 1-2 hours.  Wanted to test if “needing full rest days” is a myth, and now I am convinced it is.  You don’t need to take full days off, just rotate workouts.

My streak rule was to work out at least 15 minutes a day, but even on sick days, it was always at least 30min. Average sweat time is usually about 45min-1h per day, on good days I do 1-2 hours.  Wanted to test if “needing full rest days” is a myth, and now I am convinced it is.  You don’t need to take full days off, just rotate workouts.
2025-05-18	I realized this  Good hotels don't really seem to exist anymore in US or Europe, it's all chains now?  You can still find high quality in Dubai, Qatar, Thailand and rest of Asia though. Close to perfect service, new buildings, value for your money  I tried to figure out where are the quality hotels left? Are they some exclusive rich people member clubs?   Do people just organize everything themselves when traveling? It seems quality is lacking in hotels so much post-COVID especially  Doesn't matter if you pay more really, it's the same
2025-05-18	@levelsio this is a serious problem and there are unfortunately very few actually 5-star chains still around
2025-05-18	Example of one of my fav hotels is https://t.co/dXYny667ra  New beautiful building  Beautiful interior  Excellent high IQ staff (some are Thai that studied at Yale)  Just 10/10 how it should be https://t.co/UKe2GmYeOi
2025-05-18	And everytime I make these kinda tweets I'm like inb4 "okay princess" ye ye I get it  But somebody has to say it of course :D
2025-05-17	And inflation which happens through higher prices  But more so I notice hidden inflation where quality goes down  Like I used to buy Oikos this premium yogurt, it used to have whole milk as an ingredient  Now it's all milk powder, a lot cheaper and it tastes worse  Meanwhile price increased  Enshittification through inflation
2025-05-17	Huzzah! 🇺🇸⚔️🫖✊ https://t.co/SFwMNgrPvb
2025-05-18	Huzzah is the thing ppl in 1700s and 1800s said in Colonial America  We walked around Boston today to learn about its history a bit  It's where US independence essentially started! Very fun to see
2025-05-18	There wasn't much connection between New Amsterdam (now New York) and Boston  Boston was the Puritans, very anti-catholic, even anti-protestand and fundamentalist, they fled England to US  New Amsterdam like Netherlands then didn't care much about your religion or even ethnicity  So some ppl from Boston fled to New Amsterdam after the rules got too strict for them to live in freedom
2025-05-18	Telling you guys this is the new algo
2025-05-18	This is not a social platform anymore. Dead are the days of hanging out with friends online via Twitter. ⚰️  Nobody sees my posts now. ✌️
2025-05-17	X algo changed again  I can feel it  Barbell algo is back: regular tweets get 2 likes, radical tweets get 20,000 likes now
2025-05-18	With barbell I mean it either goes nowhere or goes extremely viral  With other types of algos you have a middle ground  With barbell algo, you make the viral posts get way more views etc. at the cost of regular posts getting close to none!
2025-05-17	Example  22 RT in 10 hours, it's crazy low for a big account like that  Would be 200 RT normally https://t.co/mYdLUEFPqU

2025-05-17	yeah I do the same for sure, it’s good to have a quality baseline lifestyle at home  seems to me it’s kinda like a barbell:  - one end people in the house constantly with ultraconvenient dopamine hit lifestyle  - people who go out a lot and try to do everything out  but then the latter means a lot of stuff is oversubscribed with stuff out -> low quality ensues
2025-05-17	How is this possible?  Just random coincidence that both happened at same time?  MITM can't do this?  If he logged in to a fake phishing page yes  I'd love to hear some theories
2025-05-16	@levelsio Was Copenhagen not Amsterdam. But in short there was a free wifi called “Copenhagen - Free Wifi” or something similar and I connected to it without thinking too much. After few mins I started getting password reset emails from Amazon and Facebook. I logged in into Prime Video

2025-05-17	Something I noticed on here  People in twenties barely ever cook or don't even know how to cook anymore  Their entire concept of meals is just from delivery apps  There was a guy on here that was concerned about microplastics and wondered "how can I eat food if delivery apps package everything in plastic" and I was like "yes you gotta cook your own food"
2025-05-17	RT @csallen: IMO the biggest way we're living in an idiocracy is minimizing the importance of community.  We're tribal animals. We're supposed to find purpose and connection from contributing to a community of people we know and love.  Instead the norm is to:  - isolate yourself solo or in a nuclear family unit - choose where to live based on granite countertops and nice closets - ignore proximity to friends, family, and community  And then say, "Oh it's fine because I've got ____" then fill in the blank with some last-100-years tech thing that only gives you 1% of the connection you need: phone calls, group texts, video games, internet communities, social media, driving/flying to see people you love 1-2x a year, etc.  So millions of people have no real community.  Then people are lonely, stressed, depressed, and wonder why.  And couples are breaking up and divorcing over the time commitment of raising kids and the monetary cost of $2000/mo/kid for childcare, wondering how it could ever be more efficient.  Even worse, nobody works on relationships.  The "healthy norm" is to cut people out and disappear into the sea of millions.  If you don't love your family, you move away. If you get in a fight with a friend, you never speak again. If you break up with an ex, the expectation is to delete them from your life as if they never existed. Etc. So nobody has relationship skills to work through challenges.  Sadly it's hard to fight against all this, except to be born into a community where these things are not the norm.

2025-05-17	I think one benefit I get being a business owner  I can detect what is marketing quite well and don't easily get sold to by brands (except WHOOP 😂 recently)  So I generally have a big distrust of stuff that's not Lindy and not simple like pre-fab Huel-type "healthy" food meals  It's still processed junk and you're better of getting a steak or chicken at butcher or supermarket and cook it with some vegetables and rice/potatoes  But that "sounds" less fancy because a steak/chicken/vegetable doesn't really market itself and has no fancy packaging
2025-05-17	@levelsio @LabGrownNeet I feel you can provide people with a clear path, but they often choose alternative routes, thinking they are shortcuts. They forget that businesses employ psychological triggers to persuade them to buy into their products.
2025-05-17	Cooking is also very time intensive  Airfryer for me helps, I just dump frozen meat and vegetables in and I get fresh cooked food back after 15-25 minutes!
2025-05-17	@levelsio cooking is so much fun too!
2025-05-16	75% of restaurant traffic is now takeout orders. Incredible. Total delivery app domination  https://t.co/h2htjjOhzV https://t.co/3ZCiDKXqOv
2025-05-17	I actually met a guy who will remain nameless 3 years ago who simply didn't eat fruit or vegetables "because he didn't like the taste" and would live on a diet of delivery food hamburgers, fries and candy  Hard to see how representative this is though  It seems it's 2 groups, either you red pill and go full fitness or you go full processed delivery food
2025-05-17	It does seem we're speedrunning into Idiocracy  Like everyone sitting in a tiny closet apartment  Ordering processed food all day  Watching screens from waking up to falling asleep  OF girls showing their ass, while crypto guys trade pump and dumps and bet on sports matches  While AI does the real work  I'm generally an optimist though but interesting where society is heading

2025-05-17	I'm not against VPNs btw  I use @mullvadnet which seem more wholesome, with principles and without the FUD marketing
2025-05-17	The VPN industry makes $70 billion per year, it's worth almost a trillion dollars  So this tweet will get a lot of pushback  If you don't believe me: ask any security researcher with credentials and they'll probably mostly agree  The big VPN companies have used lots of FUD to make people scared to access the internet without for years!
2025-05-16	HTTPS + set custom DNS to 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1 and your traffic is always private  The sites you visit are then sent to Google or Cloudflare, and HTTPS encrypts the traffic end-to-end  No need for an expensive VPN subscription in most cases  Don't fall for their FUD

2025-05-16	It's gotten a lot of better I have to say   A lot of the city is cleaned up now  Tenderloin was still very post-apocalyptic though
2025-05-16	@levelsio SF is a post apocalyptic hell hole. What do you expect
2025-05-16	chat is this true
2025-05-16	@levelsio https is fine if the wifi is safe.  if the wifi is run by a threat actor, they can redirect your traffic to fake sites &amp; simply grab your (https encrypted) info when they are no longer in transit.  vpns are marketed for many nonsense use-cases but public wifi isn‘t one of those.
2025-05-16	No it's not  Any modern browser will block you from getting redirected from with lots of alerts  https://t.co/qlGOCK5siX
2025-05-16	@levelsio No (assuming the user heeds the warnings of the browser very disruptively alerting the user that the site is unsafe and that there is an impersonator in the middle)
2025-05-16	WiFi inside SF city has been quite bad and slow for me  It seems all the hotels and cafes downtown hate the tech companies and will give you some of the slowest WiFi possible  It's so ironic they seem to hate tech, as they're the benefactory of it in terms of economic activity  SF is very similar to Portugal in that way
2025-05-16	One related note -- I've been surprised from video calls at how many SF people have very crappy WiFi at home. It's the tech capital of the world! How does this happen?
2025-05-16	It's crazy the marketing VPN companies have pushed so that now everyone thinks going on a WiFi without a VPN is dangerous  Generally it's not dangerous, you're protected by HTTPS on every website, SSH on your terminal  But VPN companies want to keep normies scared so they pay  VPNs have their role though but a lot of it is just  FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) to make money

2025-05-15	So true  Hotels, which are by definition, places you go to sleep, do a remarkably bad job at letting you get high quality sleep!
2025-05-15	i traveled an incredible amount for over a decade. I never, ever, found a hotel that reflect the importance of sleep in their design. leds flashing over the bed, ac fucked (fluctuation/settings not matching…) curtains are basically don’t look at my butt not “block the light”. Mattress always malformed. The only true place where I had the best experience ever has been in Japan. Absolutely nailed every aspect of the sleeping experience

2025-05-05	✨ Asked Cursor to build a Python IRC chat bot that uses gpt4o-mini to talk back on pieter dot com  Because most of the time people open the site, the computer loads and then mIRC chat app opens and because they didn't have chat history back then it looks a bit empty  So now you have @pieterbot to talk to 24/7, it also has the entire knowledge base so can answer you anything about what you can do do inside Windows 3.11 etc.

2025-05-15	TL;DR you can just paste your @Stripe dashboard screenshots into ChatGPT and ask it how to make more money
2025-05-15	📈 New record MRR and record low churn on Photo AI  AI models keep improving which is the main thing, for example now creating a new model of a person takes 3 minutes instead of 2 hours! Users really like to NOT wait I think  I also added single top up credits a few months ago, which stops people churning even if they're out of credits (before they'd be forced to upgrade to a higher plan)  And last week added daily emails for customers who fail their renewal payment, once they pay that last invoice, Stripe saves the updated payment method and they are "recovered" customers which in turns reduces churn. I know @Stripe sends these emails too, but they're less personal and less branded than my own text-only emails which is a bit more stern:  "Your last payment for Photo AI failed. To continue using Photo AI, keep your content and avoid service interruption, please pay your last invoice by clicking the link below and then clicking [ Pay invoice ]:  https:// photoai .com/pay?hash=  All your AI models, photos, videos and all saved content will be permanently deleted if your account remains unpaid. Please pay your last invoice as soon as possible to avoid losing your content and account access."  I also increased the recovery try time in Stripe from 1 week to 4 weeks with 8 smart retries  One other thing I'd like to try is a tip by @loaibassam to send reactivation emails, so I make a daily cron robot that sends 100 emails to old customers that churned and ask them to come back, tell them how Photo AI improved since they left, and offer a discount to sign up again, I have tens of thousands of old customers to send that to  It's always hard to say WHAT causes MRR to go up and churn to go down but something is working!
2025-04-24	So I copy pasted screenshots of Photo AI's Stripe dashboard to ChatGPT and asked it  > How I can make more money?  And it told me to chase failed payments  My payment recovery rate is 20%, Stripe says the average should be 40%  So I've added a webhook catcher that gets invoice.payment_failed, sets the user as in_recovery=true  They get an email with a link to pay their last invoice in @Stripe's customer portal and inside the app lots of alerts to pay it too  Once THAT invoice is paid, Stripe saves the new payment details to pay for the next subscription renewal, and I essentially saved the customer from auto churning due to failed payment reasons like expired cards etc.  Will report back how this improves revenue recovery!
2025-05-15	Yes but it's always scary to approach for guys  Girls know it's scary for a guy to approach them and that's why they value you do it!  It shows you're brave and even if you're nervous they appreciate you get through your fear and do it  It's cute, as long as you're nice and respectful and don't say weird shit
2025-05-15	I think the root cause of more people spending time on dating apps vs IRL is confidence. It does take balls to approach a gal/guy and start a conversation. And confidence can be trained - the more you do it the better you are at it. But ofc, why spend time and effort on this when you can simply swipe left or right on apps.
2025-05-15	OR you become top 20% of men of course
2025-05-15	As I've always said  Dating apps are a scam  They only work for the top 20% of men and it's highly likely you're not that  For women they work for pretty much everyone but you'll be the 80% of women dating the top 20% of men who will be with multiple women (essentially a harem) and will never commit to any single one (why would they) or at least likely not you  You're better off going IRL, go to where you think your type of bf/gf would hang out, or organize your own events or things. Taking action to do stuff and you will meet people  Don't dead stare on finding a bf/gf. Make friends with guys and girls and long term via all those people you're likely to meet someone  Can I somehow put exercise into this tweet? Yes I can, if you get fit you'll be WAY more attractive, that's simply how it works. And that works IRL  Delete Tinder etc

2025-05-15	My sleep before and after travel from Portugal to San Francisco (the red line)  Big drop in sleep quality from 100% to around 75%  Mostly timezone difference   But also hotel ACs even here don't get cold enough which seems like a California eco thing just like Europe  The current hotel we have is top luxury and very expensive and their black out curtains don't even black out cause they're just open on the side lmfaoo 😂  Sunset in SF is ~6am so you wake up a bit after that  Not so bad but interesting to see what I already knew for ages, and why I avoid traveling short term trips, it destroys your sleep and health  Would be fun to see a study on health of business travelers

2025-05-15	ANY exercise outperforms SSRI antidepressants btw  Dancing being remarkably great, but personally I believe strength training is very important because you increase muscle mass and bone density which helps you when you get older a lot! https://t.co/ARjjTEiWz5
2025-05-15	Because especially for smart people the answer for "why do I feel lost" can't possibly be in physical exertion  They seek it in philosophy, therapy (which has its place btw), and many then go into the deep end with Ayahuasca, or even prescription drugs thinking there's something wrong with them  But in 99% of cases there's nothing wrong with them, they're just human and humans need to move and pick up heavy objects  But that's too simple of a solution to ever be acceptable, on top of lifting weights being associated with bro culture still
2025-05-15	@levelsio Why can't more people understand this?  Move your body, your mind will love it!
2025-05-15	"But here's the unexpected thing. And let me be a little vulnerable here. Since getting back to strong growth and profitability, I've felt a little lost. I've been feeling lower motivation.  I've done a lot of soul-searching, gone on walks, written countless journal entries. I've been trying to understand: why do I feel lost, clouded, lower motivation? Surely now that we're growing and profitable again, I should feel on top of the world? What is going on?"  The answer is you have to lift weights + cardio 4 times per week  Trust me I've tried all the other things  Get a personal trainer to start and build up to actually lift heavy, that's when I started feeling the life changing mental benefits  It changed my brain to a perpetually high performing fully satisfied zen state without any anxiety, depression, neuroticism or existential angst  All of those are just signs of lack of physical exertion  Both men and women should lift + cardio  IMHO
2025-05-14	Something interesting and rather unexpected has been happening for me. At Buffer, we're very close to reaching a new all-time-high level of revenue. This has been a long journey with many ups and downs.  Our previous highest ARR was in February 2020. Following the peak we experienced 4 years of decline. It came from missteps, indecision, and being too reactive. We made significant strategy changes and operational improvements, stalled our decline in 2023, and grew strongly in 2024 (12.56%). We're on track for even greater growth in 2025.  But here's the unexpected thing. And let me be a little vulnerable here. Since getting back to strong growth and profitability, I've felt a little lost. I've been feeling lower motivation.  I've done a lot of soul-searching, gone on walks, written countless journal entries. I've been trying to understand: why do I feel lost, clouded, lower motivation? Surely now that we're growing and profitable again, I should feel on top of the world? What is going on?  I don't have all the answers yet, but I've made progress.  Fundamentally, the goal of getting back to growth and profitability was so clear and important. Removing the existential risk to Buffer was critical to our long-term goals. We recently stopped reporting our runway metric because it is now infinite.  We are default alive. It's incredible. But achieving this milestone begs the question: what next?  We've been chasing this for years, and here we are. Reaching growth and profitability again is something we're celebrating, and yet at the same time for me personally it created a slight void.  Of course, we have a deeply meaningful mission at Buffer. To help entrepreneurs, creators and small businesses get off the ground and grow through organic social media, with tools that make their lives easier and save them time. To help people go from nothing to habit and results. To help folks build something meaningful that positively impacts the lives of others.  It's this focus that guided us back to growth and profitability. I'm proud of that we got back here by staying true to our mission and values, doing right by the customer, unwinding some of the things we slipped into doing that were not in the best interest of those we set out to serve.  At the same time, the imperative loomed strong; to ensure our long-term viability to continue building something impactful. At times it felt like the goal, rather than the outcome. It's now time for that to change, which is invigorating and yet also requires a shift. A new chapter ahead for us.  I feel privileged that we have weathered our downturn, and are back to growing strongly again. Now we have the opportunity to serve people more whole-heartedly than we ever have. And our experience, learnings, and scars can guide us to make great choices for customers.  Whether you've recently discovered Buffer or have followed us, and me for the past 14 years, thank you for being part of the journey. We're excited to serve you.

Warm lighting, rich textures, and immersive motion. Cinematic drone-style shot, ultra detailed, atmospheric, 4K."  Obviously it's not there yet 100% and it tries to do whatever it can to get prompt coherence, which is interesting to see  In this case on the fly adding lots of tents and switching the lights on, not realistic, but it's goal seems to be prompt coherence first!

This trip completely shifted my mindset and how I want to approach building startups 🤯  Below is a small write-up of the full week, who I met and what I learnt.  > Why SF? A few weeks ago, @Stripe reached out to me and invited me to join Stripe Sessions (their yearly event) in San Francisco, together with a bunch of other founders/builders.  Easy answer: YES!  And that was it, two weeks ago, I found myself on the plane to the US for the first time in my life.  Had a lot of fun attending the keynotes and sessions. I lost count but I think they made 25 (!) announcements in total.  Also great to see how serious Stripe takes user feedback. It's the #1 reason I'll continue to use them for a long time to come.  > Shift in mindset As with many things, it's hard to comprehend when you look at things from a distance.  We all have seen new startups pop up in the last year and generate (tens or even hundreds of) millions of revenue in a matter of weeks or months.  It's hard to wrap my head around it, because all I see are those products, their websites and the numbers.  Now I finally got the chance to meet some of the people behind those startups and things started clicking for me:  - The level of optimism in SF is unparalleled. It really struck me. I realize that I should be more energetic about building with new tech, do so faster and don't shy away from experimenting more.  - I witnessed just how much some people are locking in. It's crazy but amazing to see! I should aim for more focus and less distraction for myself as well.  - The environment you're in can influence you heavily. That isn't necessarily new to me. But I realized that many of the limiting beliefs I have seem to come from my environment. Some of the people I've met do not seem to have anything holding them back, at all. Sky is the limit. I admire that and should adopt that mindset much more.  - SF showed me there are so many more nuances in  startups and how they do things. It's not black and white. Even within funded startups, approaches to many things wildly differ. There are many right ways to do things! They're simply dependent on a) what you build b) who you hire c) what you aim for d) what stage you're at.  > Meeting founders & friends It was amazing to meet so many people; some who I look up to and am inspired by, some who I've been talking to online for years and reuniting with friends!  - Met @patrickc, who took some time out of his incredibly busy schedule during Sessions to check in with us and ask for feedback for Stripe (thank you for listening!) - @mntruell gave a quick tour of the Cursor offices (they're incredibly cozy like a living room!) and took some time to chat with us. - Meeting up with friend @levelsio again, always enjoy the gymtiem, crazy conversations and harsh but valuable opinions! - Spent lots of time with @yasser_elsaid_, so impressed with what he's building with Chatbase. Amazing guy. - Checked out the new OpenAI HQ with @edwinarbus, thank you for the tour and dinner! - It was great to meet @kiwicopple, since Supabase is my favorite back-end platform. Paul is perhaps the most humble founder I've ever met! - Met @justinstorre who builds Helicone, prompt analytics platform that I literally can't live without anymore. We had a nice bike ride through Golden Gate park! - Met up multiple times with @jrfarr, @damengchen,  @gregisenberg, @thorwebdev, @jijosunny, @rexan_wong, @wilhelmklopp, @loaibassam (and whoever I'm forgetting, sorry), appreciate hanging out and all the conversations! - some spontaneous encounters at Bolt hackathon party (@thisiskp_, @theo, @stephsmithio) - @caitbhri @alypavs for inviting me to Stripe Sessions and tour/working from Stripe HQ.

2025-05-14	RT @jamesacowling: I designed Dropbox's storage system and modeled its durability. Durability numbers (11 9's etc) are meaningless because competent providers don't lose data because of disk failures, they lose data because of bugs and operator error.  Yes S3 has lost data. No it wasn't because some disks failed.  If you're building your own infrastructure you should heavily invest in release process and validation testing (link in reply). You're not going to do a better job than a major cloud provider though.  The best thing you can do for your own durability is to choose a competent provider and then ensure you don't accidentally delete or corrupt own data on it:  1. Ideally never mutate an object in S3, add a new version instead. 2. Never live-delete any data. Mark it for deletion and then use a lifecycle policy to clean it up after a week.  This way you have time to react to a bug in your own stack.

If VC-backed founders are making so much money from salaries and secondaries, why are almost all of them living in a damp basement in some shithole neighborhood eating ramen for dinner with no friends and family, all the way until they're 40? I think because they're almost all broke trying to please their VC overloads. It's hard to get out of that system. It's hard to let someone down who wrote you a $10M check, so you keep forgoing paying yourself until you can make it up for them. For a few years at Amazon I was on the acquisition side of some of these "modest exit" deals, and I was impressed by the level of misery I've seen. We were dangling a $40M exit, but at best the founders were going to get $1-$2M and most of the times they got nothing at all. But usually they were just relieved that the pain was over.

2025-05-13	@levelsio If you would restart (not audience). Do you think your hit rate would still be 5%? Would your audience enable you more or would this be rather a distraction for you? I think you also won at the audience level without realizing (maybe you are... it's more than 5% though)
2025-05-13	RT @dwlz: As unbelievable as this may seem, I can tell you from on-the-ground, actual experience that this is exactly what happens.  We lost several big deals ($50k+) because a board member who invested in a competitive company called the CEO and..."convinced" them.  In one egregious case, we published a case study of a huge logo on LinkedIn. A board member at big competitor noticed from their feed, and a few weeks later that customer switched to our competitor. Despite doing a full case study on how much they loved us!  It's crazy because you'd think this is made up and never happens, but it's more the reality than not. So sleazy.

2025-05-13	I know that once you raise VC they will ask their other portfolio companies to become your customer  Which is kinda a Ponzi scheme  VC invests in Company A and B both $1M (total invested $2M)  VC tells A to buy B's product for $1M  VC tells B to buy A's product for $1M  VC portfolio now has $2M ARR, at 20x multiplier that's $40M  So VC invested $2M and now his portfolio is worth $40M  So you do instantly get big customers, we indies do not!

2021-11-07	🍰 Only 4 out of 70+ projects I ever did made money and grew  📉 &gt;95% of everything I ever did failed  📈 My hit rate is only about ~5%  🚀 So...ship more https://t.co/oAn2rdRpFT
2025-05-13	The argument to be a VC funded founder that remains - you really wanna be a billionaire (realistically hard to become a billionaire as an indie, although you can def get to $50M-100M if you at the top) - you need capital to do stuff that's expensive like training foundational models (arguably there's no moat in AI models but okay) - you want to try and are okay with 95% chance you fail and then becoming an angel or VC or working at some big startup because you have the network - you really like the reputation of raising millions $$$ and think it's cool (I do not necessarily cause it's not your money to spend) - you are already rich and now want to shoot for bigger things (even if you fail you're already rich so it's not so bad)
2025-05-13	This is eerily close to my own hit rate of about 5%  If we'd actually be able see the graveyard of 95% of founders, the argument to go all in for 10 years on one startup increasingly makes less sense  The odds that you win are miniscule but you do end up wasting the best years of your 20s/30s for low pay  So the top VC hit rate is same as indie founders, but as an indie you can just try make another project and another until one hits!  In that way indie founders are kinda like VCs: they get the benefit of placing 100s of bets too but while also being founders and maintaining 100% ownership!

2025-05-13	Whoever’s doing comms for Gemini needs to apologize to Noam Shazeer and then resign  DeepMind doesn’t get nearly as much credit and attention as they deserve, and that’s because comms is vastly underperforming capabilities  You’ve got Demis, Noam, Jeff Dean, and Sergey Brin all in one place like some kind of AI Mount Rushmore, and you can’t make a play?  You’ve got Google-scale resources and you can’t orchestrate one mic drop moment?  There’s no iconic launch for a new model. No cult of diehards for a product. No coherent narrative tying together Bard, Gemini, DeepMind, Google. No clear vision for the future  Even Alphabet stock reflects the storytelling failure. There’s that big a drop because Apple says search is moving to AI? It’s that hard to picture Google winning in that future?  It’s always hard to tell from the outside what comms is doing, and the job is harder than it looks.

2025-05-12	Randomly walked into @BasedBeffJezos, founder of e/acc, the inspiration for @euaccofficial, on his way to lift weights  His deadlift is 400lbs I think 💪   I can't stop walking into people and 🐕 Labradoodles here 😂 https://t.co/Q0yEeufUsG
2025-05-12	Just met @levelsio randomly while walking in SF
2025-05-13	I'm sorry apparently I was wrong I think he deadlifts 600 lbs but maybe @BasedBeffJezos can clear this up :D
2025-05-13	Had to ask ChatGPT to generate a video prompt to do what I wanted it to do:  "A vibrant street market at sunset, filled with colorful stalls, fresh produce, and busy people shopping — the camera flies smoothly up and over the market, revealing rows of tents, sizzling food stands, hanging lanterns, and bustling crowds below. Warm lighting, rich textures, and immersive motion. Cinematic drone-style shot, ultra detailed, atmospheric, 4K."  Obviously it's not there yet 100% and it tries to do whatever it can to get prompt coherence, which is interesting to see  In this case on the fly adding lots of tents and switching the lights on, not realistic, but it's goal seems to be prompt coherence first!
2025-05-13	It goes wrong in such funny ways  I tried to make a drone camera shot that takes off from me at the street food market and then flies over me  "drone flying camera flies over the person and shows the entire food market from the sky"  Instead it spawns an entire drone out of nowhere that starts flying through the whole shot 😂😂😂  But it looks amazing to me, it's another big step forward for video models
2025-05-13	It really is an amazing video model, we're getting really very close  Still some weird stuff with the cutlery here  This is a Photo AI image generated of me at a street food market and then image-to-video with Pixverse v4 also on Photo AI https://t.co/xhVoUTCx6a
2025-05-13	Also the flames all become static objects, nice https://t.co/3UdPBR9FAA
2025-05-12	✨ Upgraded Photo AI now to @PixVerse_'s new v4 video model  It's groundbreaking and I think it's the state-of-the-art (SOTA aka best out there) video model right now   It has high prompt coherence (it follows what you tell it to do) and character stays consistent (the person doesn't mutate to someone else)  Also no visible anomalies and proper moving arms, legs, fingers, hands etc.  Third video is @fofrAI's "tiktok dancer on drone" test but with image-to-video  Press [ Make video ] on any photo to run it!

2025-05-12	It did verify  If verified the file existed on R2 but with the truncated file name!
2025-05-12	@Addiedesignco @levelsio @Cloudflare Also using two-step phase could have helped: 1) transfer and verify it works 2) delete images from vps
2025-05-12	Yes agreed I should test more but I got used to it working perfectly fine so many times  Which is kinda the danger  Good to have an insane number of backups
2025-05-12	@levelsio @Cloudflare Did you get to test the script with 100 images before the full scale transfer? Maybe that would've helped   I'm always on the edge when transferring any sort of file on any environment lol https://t.co/wVWWW2TTRA
2025-05-12	Yesterday I wanted to move 40GB of images from my QR menu site qrmenucreator . com from my VPS to R2  R2 is @cloudflare's S3-compatible file storage, cheap and nice and I use it for all my projects  So I asked gemini-2.5-pro-max to write a script to move the files  I even asked it to check everything was correct  It then ran for hours and moved 40GB of images to R2  Then I added an Nginx redirect to R2, but the QR menu images didn't show up  Turns out for some reason the filenames got shortened somehow, which is a disaster because the QR site is quite basic and the image paths are written in the markdown of the menus  Of course the script already deleted 40GB of images from the VPS  Luckily I have more backups than you can count on your hand so I asked @DanielLockyer to restore the QR menu images folder and now it's all good  But lesson learnt: be very careful with AI code, it made a mistake, couldn't even find the mistake when I asked it to double check the code, and because the ENDs of the filenames looked same I didn't notice it cut the beginnings off  This is why I'm both a big fan of AI code and scary of it, you might miss something like this in a more critical code set up like airplane code and not find out until it's too late  And in this case AI can't even find its own mistakes
2025-05-12	This is the site https://t.co/Sj0ZAg7RaG  I felt rly bad cause the images didn't work for a few hours because thousands of restaurants actually use it for their menus so I'm happy it's fixed

2025-05-12	RT @jeremybernier: Glad you enjoyed SF. The city has definitely cleaned up since the new mayor (I randomly met him on a Saturday night patrolling the streets and he does indeed seem legit). The OpenAI office looks great. SF def has the highest talent density in tech.  Personally though as a big city person who used to live in cities like NYC and Seoul, I've found the city underwhelming as a place to live. Although the parks are beautiful, SF itself is very small, closes early, and there's not much going on compared to a proper big city. The architecture has its character, but isn't modern or inspiring. There's not a lot of people walking around so can feel quite dead. Weather doesn't get freezing, but summers are relatively cold and windy. People don't dress particularly well. There's not much going on outside of tech. Culturally the city is a bit weird and monoculture like. Although the IQs are high, there's not a lot of personality here (most tech workers don't have much personality or social skills, I say that as a tech worker).  It's quite the juxtaposition that the city at the forefront of AI and technology is a small port town that more resembles a second-tier Scandinavian city.

2025-05-11	I still believe the same as I did 10 years ago  VC funding doesn't make sense for 99% of businesses and there's a lower probability that the founder gets rich than if you go indie due to the nature of it  You have to go big ($1B) or bust ($0), there's no comfortable $1M/year or $10M/year in between, it's not enough to make VCs happen, you have to grow  It makes sense if you're already validated making $100K/mo, in an extremely high growth industry, and need extreme amounts of capital  For OpenAI obviously massive funding makes sense  For a calendar app it absolutely does not make any sense and never will I think
2025-05-11	@levelsio @OpenAI @edwinarbus @stripe So, does SF convince you to go the VC-backed route?
2025-05-11	This is why being an AI threadboi, or replyguy, or using an AI reply bot has a negative return long term  You won't make genuine friendships with people on here that way!
2025-05-11	@levelsio Love this reminder that genuine connections on Twitter can lead to meaningful relationships and opportunities, not just retweets
2025-05-11	✨ This week I visited @OpenAI's office to finally meet @edwinarbus  Edwin used to work at @Stripe for I think almost 10 years and we jokingly would call him the actual CEO of Stripe because he'd be responsible for so many things and was actually running a lot of it, and he helped me and my friends out so many times when he had issues with Stripe  We brought him a 🥮 Pastel de Nata baking kit from Portugal. Which is funny, you have a Dutch guy here promoting Portugal :D  Edwin recently joined OpenAI and it was interesting to visit. They said they doubled in size in employee size in just a year or less I think and just moved into a new office  It's a beautiful glass office, I think 9 floors, open, amazing interior design and just super spacious. If anything it reminds me of modern university buildings in Netherlands but just a lot more beautiful  It was also interesting to see startups at different sizes, this week we also visited @cursor_ai and it's a cute and cozy office, with a valuation of $9B. So you can see the difference between that and OpenAI at $300B. It's 30x bigger and it feels like that of course  One thing that's hard to explain to people here is how crazy all of this is. You eat the free Stripe conference lunch box or the employee buffet at the OpenAI office and it's better than a lot of the food that you pay for in Europe (inb4 cancelled by Euros, it's just true, esp Southern Europe). There was people at the Stripe conference holding signs all day to show you where to go. Like imagine having so much money you can pay people to hold a sign, it's next level 😂  The abundance of resources and wealth here is just crazy. I'm not an SF noob, this isn't new to me, I lived here in 2012. I know how it works. But when you visit the startups and people here, you're just wow. The biggest and most important companies in the world are either here or in Asia, and they're in the most important industry of our time: AI. So it completely makes sense this is where the resources are. But you feel the people inside of Silicon Valley, working here, living here, are barely aware of the crazy and unique reality they're in compared to the rest of the world  I've always enjoyed being one foot in Silicon Valley and one foot out. I'm connected to the people here via X, and I like to visit. Most of the stuff I use comes from here: the technology I use to built my websites/apps, where my sites are hosted, how I get my money (Stripe), most of the new AI tech I use was invented and commercialized here, many of my big customers are from here too, and maybe most important a lot of tech culture that has become part of my personality comes from here  But personally I was never physically here a lot, I never raised VC money, instead I bootstrapped and lived and traveled around the world. Digital nomading mostly in Asia for a decade and then the last few years in Portugal in my quaint little beach town, and I think this gives me an interesting perspective on all of this, I'm in tech but also I'm not  I asked Edwin "isn't all of this crazy, the abundance of everything here" when I visited OpenAI's beautiful office and he answered "well we need it to attract the best employees" so the beautiful office, the amazing food, it's all employee perks of course, and it's a rational answer to a more emotional question that is impossible to answer when you live here because how could you not start thinking all of this is anything other than normal?  Silicon Valley sucks up all of the world's money, increasingly more with AI now, and of course that brings massive technological breakthroughs that benefit humanity for all of us, but I cannot even imagine being in the Silicon Valley bubble and traveling to the rest of the world and being shocked at the state of it compared to here  Of course, you think, "with exception being the streets of San Francisco that are full of poverty"  Well yes, but maybe not anymore  I've been a massive critic of San Francisco for years esp 2019-2023 because it was such a shitshow here on the streets with homeless encampments and drugs, buglaries, car robberies, just super unsafe, and I remember you couldn't really talk about that on X, and people from SF just flat out lied and denied the reality (maybe because they owned homes here? :D). And even a year ago when I visited here it was still a complete shitshow  This time San Francisco honestly looked completely different  The new mayor @DanielLurie has actually cleaned up the city. You still see homeless, but not so much. They mostly stay under the radar. No crazy shouting and getting chased by them anymore (yes that was normal!). I didn't see any shooting up of drugs anymore  There's a police presence on many blocks now, in front of the OpenAI office a motorbike police officer was stationed, so of course I walked up to him to tell him "so I drove your bike in GTA a lot", expecting to get arrested, instead he told me "you wanna get on?" so I did haha  San Francisco is actually getting beautiful again. And it feels like how it looked when I was living here in 2012 with my friend Jim when we both worked on our master's thesis from here, which I have to talk about in another blog post (it involved paying $1000/mo to live in a basement in Portrero Hills with a German landlord that had a 🪿 goose in the house that wore diapers)  w/ @Erwin_AI @yasser_elsaid_ @loaibassam

2025-05-11	@levelsio @elevenlabsio Yeah that’s what me (a 14 y/o) and my Co-founder are trying to do in our landing page at Calendaty
2025-05-11	I really like @elevenlabsio's interactive landing page  My favorite landing pages are the ones that drop you straight into the application and let you use it, you barely see that though  I think it makes sense because why would you even need to sell to a customer with a big sales-y landing page if your product is impressive enough to convince them to buy it just by using it?  ElevenLabs does a great mix of being able to actually use all the basic features as a demo while still being a traditional landing page  This is easier with sites like Nomad List, because people just browse cities and it doesn't cost me much, but it's much harder to do this with AI apps because they cost a lot of money for every time you generate something (like photo, audio or text).  One idea I had for Photo AI is to pre-generate a lot of combos of photos then on the landing page make a little demo and let them choose default models (like white man, black woman, etc.) and prompts etc. Then I just pre-gen all those combinations (like 10,000 pics, maybe $100) and I can have a demo on the landing page  Unaffiliated with ElevenLabs btw, just like the website!
2025-05-11	On a meta level posting tweets can also be how you make friends  This is a quote tweet of my tweet by a famous tech journalist who now runs a big PR firm  So just tweeting gets you in touch with people  It seems weird to explain this stuff cause it's so obvious to me but I always see people here ask how does this stuff work and nobody wants to explain it cause it's so cringe to explain it

2025-05-10	So how this stuff works nobody will ever tell you so I will tell you  Networking doesn't exist, it's just meeting fun people who do cool stuff, and you get access to them when you do cool stuff yourself, cool stuff in our scene means make nice things/products and get users and make money and have some impact on the world  I know @yasser_elsaid_ cause he started showing up on my X feed with his app @chatbase_co, I think when he shared revenue numbers  Started very small and grew fast and he's bootstrapped and indie so that's very cool (for me)  Then I probably followed him, which means my DM is then open for him and he asked me advice  He could have asked smth annoying like "can you RT this" or some marketing spam like many do, but instead he just asked advice which is fun to give for most ppl  Then I met him when meeting  @Erwin_AI the gym here in SF this week. Erwin in turn is my friend I met in Bali in 2019 at a pool party I organized and he also makes indie startups  All these ppl are chill and not annoying, high IQ and fun to hang with and successful  So generally if you're successful, share that, and are also smart and fun, you meet people like this easily  None of these people are annoying, annoying for me is marketing-ey, asking for RTs, being pushy, or playing padel
2025-05-11	Buying a house is the worst financial decision I ever made except for buying Alibaba stock just before they arrested Jack Ma  It only made sense because in my little beach town there's not a big supply of good rentals and most goes to Airbnb in the summer and stuff gets booked a year in advance  Having the house, now with a home gym, jacuzzi and sauna we added and stuff like Starlink, is nice, a soon self sufficient fortress we can get back to  But financially it will probably never be a good decision, which is fine  But renting is NOT throwing money away, especially if the supply of rentals is good: I've rented all my life, lived in hostel dorms, hotel rooms, then suites, then apartments, especially in South East Asia the supply of housing is abundant, newly built and amazingly luxurious to live in  The flexibility of not being stuck to a place is amazing  The only argument I can think of for buying is 1) mine (no good rental housing supply) and 2) that most people don't have the cash lying around to just buy a house, so it's the only loan/leverage they can get for a big amount, but that loan is also not without risk (see underwater mortgages)  If you do have cash and can buy a house with it, it's debatable if you should buy or not, because at that point you can have the flexibility of living in the most beautiful rentals and Airbnbs of the world and bouncing around the world, I did that  I think what's important is breaking this cult of home ownership which is a real religion worldwide, with a lot of pressure put on people to buy or "get on the housing ladder early or be too late" as Dutch people would pressure me into it when I lived in Netherlands  I think we should be quite wary of middle class people taking on a 30-year million dollar loan as it's literally a ball and chain  There is a shortage of housing everywhere, the solution is to build more housing, one reason we're not building more housing is that it's beneficial for home owners if prices keep rising  But prices only rise with shortage of supply, it's quite a messed up dynamic  Realistically we WILL build more housing soon because the shortage we have worldwide is unsustainable and will cause revolt if we do not  If that happens home prices will start dropping and it's not a good investment anymore  Sorry for rant but yes interesting topic
2025-05-11	i 100% get the emotional reaction people have about "throwing away money on rent" but this is spot on.  owning a home has an obscene number of hidden maintenance costs and mental overhead.

2025-05-09	for the first five years of operating @supabase received just 3 TrustPilot reviews  since our funding was announced 1 month ago we have received 5 negative reviews  call me cynical, but i find it very hard to believe that trustpilot isn't running a racket: seed your page with negative reviews so that you're forced to send users to trustpilot with positive reviews (so they get more traction). oh! and don't forget to pay $339/m so that your team can respond to negative reviews  we're opting out - i'm happy to rank in the same league some of the best products available today
2025-05-10	Explanation by @MattiSchroder  https://t.co/8sZSIZw5e1
2025-03-01	Wow, @Trustpilot is misleading, predatory, and all other similar words you can think of.  I randomly noticed that we average 3.4 on our Trustpilot reviews. Which seemed weird when we average 4.9 over 7660 reviews through @judgeme_reviews.  So, I did the math. We have 126 Trustpilot reviews:  1 star: 5 2 star 0 3 star: 2 4 star: 16 5 star: 103  Arithmetic average: 4.68 Average according to Trustpilot aka. their TrustScore: 3.4 🙃  Wtf?  Their explanation:  "The calculation is based on various parameters such as a company's total number of reviews and the date the reviews were created.  The TrustScore is also affected by whether a company actively invites its customers to review them or not."  Let me translate that for you: Trustpilot deliberately lower the average ratings of merchants using other review platforms and masks it as a proprietary "TrustScore algorithm".   In reality, the only way to get many reviews, recent reviews, and actively invite customers to review on Trustpilot - the "various parameters" in their explanation - is... by using Trustpilot.  The last Trustpilot quote I got was $400/month. And that's over 5 years ago when we were a fraction of the business we are to day.  So, because I'm not willing to pay that, which I wouldn't be surprised is +$1000/month now, they just smudge our brand by giving us a bad score instead.  SCAM.

Erwin in turn is my friend I met in Bali in 2019 at a pool party I organized and he also makes indie startups  All these ppl are chill and not annoying, high IQ and fun to hang with and successful  So generally if you're successful, share that, and are also smart and fun, you meet people like this easily  None of these people are annoying, annoying for me is marketing-ey, asking for RTs, being pushy, or playing padel

2025-05-10	If the revenue share keeps paying at this level, journalists around the world should really consider posting on X as their main job.  Maybe also posting on Youtube, as it also pays well.  But just payouts from social media can surpass their current salary, if they just keep posting regularly and be patient.  Plus they also get much more freedom with this type of arrangement.

2025-05-08	⚡ The levels of reverse engineering and intelligence gathering now possible for anyone using AI are straight out of science fiction.  I asked ChatGPT o3 to analyze the whiteboard fragments visible in the photo taken by @levelsio with @mntruell at Cursor's office, and it blew my mind 🤯  It automatically cropped parts of the image, had them analyzed, and eventually extracted a series of conclusions that are potentially golden nuggets of information:  ### Internal Architecture & Infrastructure (from the whiteboard)  - Cursor uses a multi-stage data pipeline starting from raw data to production-level applications. - There is a “Datagen” module, likely short for data generation, used to create synthetic or augmented datasets. - The Datagen process runs on Kubernetes (k8s), indicating containerized workloads and scalable orchestration. - Their pipeline includes stages for:   - Pre-processing & training from raw data.   - Application-specific processed data.   - Model training or usage.   - Data generation on k8s.   - Feeding the result into an APP, likely the main product or API.  ### DevOps & Deployment Practices  - They rely on YAML-based configuration for automation and infrastructure, including:   - pipeline.yaml   - service-prod.yaml - This suggests use of tools like Argo Workflows, GitHub Actions, or other GitOps tools. - There is a clear promotion path across environments:   - dev → validation → prod - Their production environment ("prod") connects to:   - svc (internal services)   - traffic (likely load balancing or ingress)   - creds (centralized credential management)  ### Security & Observability  - Explicit notes suggest:   - Audit logging of SSH sessions and commands.   - Logging of service behavior. - Indicates SOC 2-level observability, compliance-aware practices, and active monitoring of operational activity. - Likely centralized logging and access control mechanisms.  ### Terminology & Internal Components Leaked  - Component names revealed:   - Datagen, APP, pipeline.yaml, service-prod.yaml - These are likely internal microservices or repos. - The term “Datagen” is not mentioned in public Cursor documentation, suggesting a non-public internal system. - Layout shows modular architecture, possibly microservices linked by Kubernetes.  ### Technical Competence & Maturity  - Use of Kubernetes, YAML workflows, and observability tools indicates:   - A mature MLOps and DevOps culture.   - Well-established CI/CD pipelines.   - Attention to infrastructure-as-code and compliance. - These aren't MVP-stage drawings, they reflect a real, operational internal system.

2025-05-07	Today is my third day in sf. I asked a bunch of VC backed founders if I should fund raise, every single one said no.  If you’re able to get to $1M arr bootsrapped, just use the revenue to grow. And if you’re not able to, you will struggle getting to $100m arr even with the funding (lowest bar for vc).  This only applies for saas that’s not a vs code fork. If you’re building deep tech or vs code forks, you should raise as much as you can.

2025-05-07	Travel is so destructive to sleep https://t.co/HuUvb0iVB7
2025-04-27	How I get 100% perfect sleep:  - very cold bedroom 18-20°C / 64-68°F (colder better) - 9kg weighted blanket by CURA (adjust to your bodyweight) - separate duvet from gf (I do this for years this might be the biggest sleep improvement) - 3M ear plugs (I tried Ohropax wax but they only half as silent) - eye mask - red LED lights that go on before sleep in bedroom - 0.2mg melatonin 45min before sleep then dim the lights (melatonin is ALWAYS sold in too high dose like 3mg, it should be 10x less or it doesn't work!) - 4x per week cardio + strength training, my resting heart rate (RHR) is 52 - mostly clean diet of meat + vegetables + fruit + black coffee + sparkling water with lemon (and sometimes cheat with dark choco), not a lot of carbs (almost never pasta or regular potatoes for ex but sometimes rice or sweet potatoes) - healthy biomarkers and body mass index, if you're overweight it WILL affect your sleep usually with sleep apnea etc - read phone before sleep but with Smart Invert on and my custom super dark hack using iOS Zoom (but it doesn't zoom it just decreases brightness even further), then read Kindle a bit to really make me sleepy 😂 - we try avoid eating after 10pm, and we sleep around midnight to 1am, especially sweet stuff like fruits seem to have a bad effect on my sleep - also DO not drink 2-3 hours before sleep or you wake up to go pee (which is more common when you get older) - disclaimer: no kids (yet) so easy talking  Other things:  Temperature seems to be the biggest impact for me, if it gets too hot I wake up and once I wake up my brain gets active and it's sometimes hard to fall asleep. I already had this years ago and thought it was stress but even if I have life stuff going along I can sleep solid 8h without waking up if it's just a very cold bedroom.  If it's really super cold like 17-18°C / 62-64°FI just never wake up  For that you need a thick duvet though and your gf needs thicker cause women are generally colder  If you're culturally used to sleeping hotter, consider changing that because it seems to benefit almost anyone to sleep colder! An AC will do the trick.  As @bryan_johnson tells everyone, sleep is the most important thing to prioritize for your health  Good sleep benefits all your health markers, your immune system and so stops you from getting sick. Even cleaning your brain of plaque to avoid dementia when you're older

Get your money and GTFO  Unless working there is your dream of course  Also the cash is never worth it to waste your young years in your 20s and 30s being miserable in meetings for the company that acquired you  The irony of having so much money but so little freedom!!!

2025-05-07	Interesting thing I noticed  Everytime I go to America it increasingly looks more like Europe and vice versa  Because every single thing made is just resold but made in China so in a way the Chinese design how our cities look like now  From things like uniform patio umbrellas to window frames to kitchen materials  Before there'd be an American supplier and a Dutch supplier that had specific differences in style for their country/region  Now it's all Chinese so the highest value per dollar product wins and Americans and Europeans agree on the same best product  Bit related to Michel Houellebecq's quote about global uniformity "the whole world will start to look like an airport"  Unlike him I don't think it's necessarily bad btw, I just noticed it, I think it's progress  Left: US, right: NL

It changed the nature of civilization by making development possible in the tropics.   Without air conditioning you can work only in the cool early-morning hours or at dusk.   The first thing I did upon becoming prime minister was to install air conditioners in buildings where the civil service worked. This was key to public efficiency."

2025-05-06	RT @JohnONolan: Another year, and several milestones all at once.   12 years since @Ghost launched on Kickstarter, now at $8M ARR, and powering almost $100M in revenue for independent publishers 📈  A few thoughts and reflections on building an open source publishing platform, for a long time.  I was 24 when I first started working on the idea for Ghost, and back then I had no idea what I was doing.  Fast forward to 2025 and I still have no idea what I'm doing, but we've come a long way. What started as little more than an idealistic open source pipedream has blossomed into a sustainable non-profit org with a full-time team of 34.  The core idea behind Ghost, in 2013, was a simple one. I've always believed that independent publishing on the web is essential, and that the technology behind it plays a significant role in its ultimate success or failure.  Back then, Vox and Buzzfeed were at the forefront of a major shift in the publishing industry. Being technology startups as much as media companies, their proprietary software was a distribution lever to which the rest of the industry had no answer.

2025-05-06	Another year, and several milestones all at once.   12 years since @Ghost launched on Kickstarter, now at $8M ARR, and powering almost $100M in revenue for independent publishers 📈  A few thoughts and reflections on building an open source publishing platform, for a long time.  I was 24 when I first started working on the idea for Ghost, and back then I had no idea what I was doing.  Fast forward to 2025 and I still have no idea what I'm doing, but we've come a long way. What started as little more than an idealistic open source pipedream has blossomed into a sustainable non-profit org with a full-time team of 34.  The core idea behind Ghost, in 2013, was a simple one. I've always believed that independent publishing on the web is essential, and that the technology behind it plays a significant role in its ultimate success or failure.  Back then, Vox and Buzzfeed were at the forefront of a major shift in the publishing industry. Being technology startups as much as media companies, their proprietary software was a distribution lever to which the rest of the industry had no answer. They were miles ahead of traditional media orgs, many of whom had only recently been convinced of the need for a website.  It was as if a couple of outlets had built the world's first printing press, while everyone else was still sitting around writing out news bulletins by hand.  The ambition for Ghost was to create a dedicated open technology stack for independent publishers, from solo-creators to large newsrooms, to compete in a fast-moving digital media landscape – without becoming beholden to closed networks owned and controlled by private companies like Facebook and Medium.

2025-05-06	I think this is short sighted and also wishful thinking  Innovations are usually combinations of existing things put together in a new "novel" way  LLMs are trained on existing things (not novel)  I agree an LLM by itself probably can't innovate well, but a human using it as a tool and directing it to create new original ideas can be novel  It's a misconception to think LLMs just generate copies of existing apps/games etc. it doesn't, there's emergent understanding by models and on top of that you also still prompt it like 100s of times to create something  There's a lot of human direction there that makes it novel  Hollywood probablu uses the same camera for most movies, but that doesn't mean all movies are rehashes of other ones  The camera is a tool used by a director, just like an LLM is for a developer, what they choose to do with it is what makes it novel
2025-05-06	Don't forget that LLMs / AI coding tools are NOT good at building novel things. They are good at copying what is out there and what they've been trained on  Right now, cutting-edge startups are building *so much* novel software, using new libraries, frameworks etc.  Guess who you need to get these done? That's right: software engineers (who often use AI tools for the non-novel stuff btw!)
2025-05-06	Wishful thinking in that I think @GergelyOrosz's audience of devs likes to hear this because it reduces AI fear  Which isn't on purpose btw, I think we're both honest about how we think about these things and it's a good debate

2025-05-06	The drink 2 liters per day rule everyone misinterpreted because it also should count the water from all the food you eat  It also completely depends on your diet, your environment, the temperature (how much you sweat etc)  So everyone's probably completely overdoing it with hydration  My point is your body knows very well when it's thirsty and then you drink  People stopped trusting their body's signals
2025-05-06	@levelsio also there is a misconception about „hidration“. its more about giving your body salt, electrolytes instead of water on mass. also the arbitrary „rule“ of 2-3 liters is a made up thing.
2025-05-06	Coffee is NOT dehydrating  Super big urban myth that people still believe  Coffee is literally 99% water! https://t.co/J6MNaiqm51
2025-05-06	@levelsio Partially bad-take: - “thirst” is a lagging indicator → by the time you're thirsty, you’re mildly dehydrated - IF you supplement with creatine → it dehydrates you so you need to drink more water - IF you drink coffee / alcohol → you feel you drank liquids but they dehydrate
2025-05-06	RT @jdnoc: @levelsio Almost everything in the “standard American diet” dehydrates you. The obsession with drinking water is just a mask for not eating healthy.

2025-05-06	RT @yongfook: On "shipping 10 ideas fast" vs "having a product vision"...  Until you have been in the trenches and shipped 20 or 30 products, you don't realise that actually most ideas you have kind of suck. Or it's a nice idea but with no market. Or it's something that you thought was cool but got instantly bored with.  Shipping many things is not about trying to find "random success" it's about learning a lesson each time, and applying it to the next one.  Thinking that you can go into a cave and work on one thing and for it to become a success because of "product vision" is sheer fantasy / hubris.   My money is on the people consistently shipping things and learning along the way.

2025-05-05	It's true, because you already got the main currency, so the only currency left is time  Time you get more of if you stay alive longer and healthier (longevity)  If you're not rich, you don't really have the time or money to do all that, although you still can
2025-05-05	@levelsio When people gets rich, they get so obsessed with their health
2025-05-05	I know an oddly high amount of Brazilians who live and work in Ireland  Maybe it's lack of personal finance education in Brazil, but it doesn't make any economic sense whatsoever:  They go to Ireland because they can make A LOT more money than in Brazil: average salary is $600/mo in Brazil vs $3,600/mo in Ireland, so 6x higher  But then the sky high cost of living and taxes eat most of that up, it's 3x more expensive to live than Brazil while taxes are also way higher. So almost all the benefits you got from moving from Brazil to Ireland are eaten up by cost of living and taxes  And you just moved from a place with nice weather for the most part to one where it's rainy, why?!
2025-05-05	@levelsio Add the 52% income tax, terrible healthcare and terrible infrastructures on top 😂  Lived in Dublin for 3 years. Good for tech jobs and people is nice, but everything else is pretty much bad.
2025-05-05	I forgot to say of course many move for safety, but my Brazilian friend got robbed in Dublin by a car, they grabbed her bag but she had a crossbag over her body so she was dragged along with the car outside and got injuries  And this was in a good part of Dublin  Kinda violent
2025-05-05	And if you wanna move out of Brazil for safety reasons, there's better options than Ireland, like Portugal or Spain
2025-05-05	Actually what we discovered with friends here  If you sit in a room with enough people and the windows remain closed  The CO2 levels get to such high levels (like 3000) and it really starts to feel like everyone's drunk :D  Cause high CO2 makes your IQ drop fast
2025-05-05	@shw1nm @levelsio Also this is POV from lived experience. I still drink time to time but learned that needing alcohol to enjoy time w friends is one of the biggest lies we’re fed.
2025-05-05	I don't know anyone who still regularly drinks alcohol  A year ago or so, we had an old friend who was a daily drinker visit our little beach village  He obviously had an alcohol problem, but he also said he didn't feel like changing that, spreading his arms wide during the dinner I had with him shouting "I LOVE ALCOHOL" and then buying shots for the waiter staff and forcing them to drink it 🤦‍♂️   Every time we met him alcohol was involved  Since he had zero plan to change that we stopped hanging out with him  I've seen A LOT of families around me destroyed by alcohol and I have zero plan to go the same way  It seems people can handle alcohol fine until life gives them setbacks and then it spirals out into a full blown addiction, at a time frame of 40 years everyone's life will have setbacks so that's a massive risk  Me and my friends are all in our 30s and slowly designed our life around making cool things, being financially independent from making those things and then enjoying life, hanging out with each other, and health: fitness, sports, sauna, good clean food, no processed junk (okay but only very very sometimes ;) and almost never ever alcohol  Having someone come into the healthy community you built for years and try to get everyone to fuck up again was an interesting experience  Luckily nobody was interested to participate  Not a judgement thing btw, I think you should do whatever in your 10s and 20s, but in your 30s it starts actually affecting your health  Which is also cool if you want that but I don't want that personally nor do my friends  One photo of that night, everyone drank sparkling water except our guest   I'm personally very happy to see alcohol dying out
2025-05-05	Most of my buds do not drink.   I've been thinking drinking has been declining a ton.   But I wasn't sure if it was just because I don't drink and so that's who I hang with.  Its great to see alcohol being less popular!

2025-05-05	@levelsio Been saying this for years, that's why people get violent in hot countries (or why on the tropical belt people are, on average, low IQ).
2025-05-05	Ireland is a tax haven for corporations (and ironically ETF investors via UCITS) worldwide  Meanwhile they make it completely impossible for Irish people or Irish residents to ever become rich because of their insanely predatory taxes on investments  41% capital gains + every 8 years they'll tax your unrealized gains even if you didn't sell it, that's crazy!  Massive 🖕 FU to its own people while being a financial slave to international corporations like Google etc.  That's on top of the 250+ days per year that the weather is overcast and grey and the sky high cost of living  So even if you make money in Ireland, you can't invest it cause your returns get nuked by insane taxes, and then if you want to spend the money you're left with, everything is too expensive and it's grey and/or raining outside  I'd GTFO immediately 😂

2025-05-05	Temperature is DIRECTLY related to intelligence  We need a Kardashev Scale for airconditioning:  💨 more AC  = 📉 lower temperature = 📈 higher IQ  Fastest way to get the entire world high IQ and highly developed is blast more AC not less, that's why Europe's sabotage of AC is so silly, it's literally making everyone in Europe dumber and poorer  Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore:  "Air conditioning was a most important invention for us, perhaps one of the signal inventions of history.   It changed the nature of civilization by making development possible in the tropics.   Without air conditioning you can work only in the cool early-morning hours or at dusk.   The first thing I did upon becoming prime minister was to install air conditioners in buildings where the civil service worked. This was key to public efficiency."
2025-05-05	I will burn a diesel engine to make sure my AC is cold enough. I don't care. I keep my home at 18 degrees celsius. I hate the heat. I can't think with the heat. Your brain shrinks due to the heat. You, at your 22 degree celsius home, can't think as fast as me, an 18 celsius chad

2025-05-05	I don't know anyone who still regularly drinks alcohol  A year ago or so, we had an old friend who was a daily drinker visit our little beach village  He obviously had an alcohol problem, but he also said he didn't feel like changing that, spreading his arms wide during the dinner I had with him shouting "I LOVE ALCOHOL" and then buying shots for the waiter staff and forcing them to drink it 🤦‍♂️   Every time we met him alcohol was involved  Since he had zero plan to change that we stopped hanging out with him  I've seen A LOT of families around me destroyed by alcohol and I have zero plan to go the same way  It seems people can handle alcohol fine until life gives them setbacks and then it spirals out into a full blown addiction, at a time frame of 40 years everyone's life will have setbacks so that's a massive risk  Me and my friends are all in our 30s and slowly designed our life around making cool things, being financially independent from making those things and then enjoying life, hanging out with each other, and health: fitness, sports, sauna, good clean food, no processed junk (okay but only very very sometimes ;) and almost never ever alcohol  Having someone come into the healthy community you built for years and try to get everyone to fuck up again was an interesting experience  Luckily nobody was interested to participate  Not a judgement thing btw, I think you should do whatever in your 10s and 20s, but in your 30s it starts actually affecting your health  Which is also cool if you want that but I don't want that personally nor do my friends  One photo of that night, everyone drank sparkling water except our guest   I'm personally very happy to see alcohol dying out
2025-05-05	Most of my buds do not drink.   I've been thinking drinking has been declining a ton.   But I wasn't sure if it was just because I don't drink and so that's who I hang with.  Its great to see alcohol being less popular!

2025-05-05	✨ Asked Cursor to build a Python IRC chat bot that uses gpt4o-mini to talk back on pieter dot com  Because most of the time people open the site, the computer loads and then mIRC chat app opens and because they didn't have chat history back then it looks a bit empty  So now you have @pieterbot to talk to 24/7, it also has the entire knowledge base so can answer you anything about what you can do do inside Windows 3.11 etc.

2025-05-04	Nope I just use AC in my home bedroom set to 18°C  The problem is in Europe ACs either don't exist, are underpowered or in many hotels set to a minimum of 25°C in many parts of Italy, or 22°C in Spain and Portugal  Even if you can cool it to 22°C, they are underpowered and their sensors rekt so practically I've tested it with a temperature sensor to be about 23-26°C in most European hotels  It doesn't matter what you pay btw, I've paid for regular hotel bedrooms, premium ones, giant suites, all the ACs here are too warm  In Asia you can get actual cold hotel rooms like 16-18°C with powerful ACs, the malls are cold with AC, the cafes are perfect temperature, but but you might need a hoodie sometimes  This makes me PTSD of ever booking a hotel in Europe or traveling here, I'd rather fly out from Portugal to US, Dubai and Asia where the AC actually works and I can sleep well  Sounds crazy but yes it's that important for sleep as @hubermanlab  says too

Engineering and design are headed into a world where most of the output is produced by prompting, if not all.  The way we interview engineers has already been trending in this direction. At Vercel, we don’t care if you memorized every API and module. When we look at your coding, we assess the quality of your thinking and collaboration. It’s more so an evaluation of your “thinking tokens” or reasoning trace. In fact, the more you expose it, walking through how you backtrack, pivot, adjust, consult, the better signal we get.  My prediction is that the demand for great thinkers will remain unabated. It’s unclear if we’ll call them engineers or if it’ll matter, because these people will have a lot of full stack impact on the whole business, as they’ll have access to prompt their way to any successful outcome.

2025-05-04	RT @StefanBuilds: While I agree with you, I don't think reasoning by analogy works well for AI.   If it truly gets to AGI, then I think it is unlike any of the prior revolutions in human history, which were both based on improving the efficiency of manual labor.  Humans can do 2 things: manual labor and intellectual labor.  We've already automated a lot of the manual labor. And the AI robots will clean up the rest. And if we get AGI, then that takes care of the intellectual labor.   So what's left?  Sure, there may be a transition period where the AI is not quite good enough to be left unsupervised, where the companies that outcompete will be the ones that enable their entire workforce and scale that to the limit. But I think that's a transient state, until the AI gets good enough to be left on its own. Then the companies that outcompete will be the ones that lean into this and go full AI workforce.  I think many people are comforted by looking at past human history where jobs number go up due to technology and assume the same will happen here. I personally don't think so, and I think we need to get ready for that new reality.   What does the world look like with 50% unemployment? Or 80%?

2025-05-04	One industry where automation did not create more jobs was agriculture for example: https://t.co/WIgSymxxd0
2025-05-04	This is in so many levels wrong, pun intended.  World has not capped out benefits of "Software is eating the world" but are rather productivity limit is saturated with delays and capped with costs of doing software (like a blacksmith cannot compete with a modern factory).  Yes, bad coders will vanish, but massive amounts of capable engineers will take their place.  It is almost the same situation as at the beginning of industrial revolution, it was not just that when you replace the blacksmith and have a machine create a plow.   This is our perception now, what we should see is a CNC machine equivalent for coding. Code machinists are the productive force of software factory where it does not resemble a sweatshop but a perfectly tuned Tesla like factory.  What is the proportion of blacksmiths to todays manufacturing industry? Im quite sure there are more people working in manufacturing today than blacksmithing ever through out human history.  This is what AI as coding assistant will enable. All the blacksmithing and artisan style coding (90% of all coding today) will be replaced with something that resembles more other engineering disciplines in quality and quantity.  Welcome to the industrial revolution of Software Engineering.

2025-05-03	And another good counterpoint:
2025-05-03	I'm squarely in the camp of believing that there is an insatiable demand for software, and until that stops, software engineers are going to be in overwhelmingly short supply in the long term.  AI is forcing companies to recalibrate their resources (we're all seeing that now with layoffs and freezes), but once AI is more-or-less saturated among most companies, hiring more engineers will, once again, be the only way to build more product than the competition.  And yes, being better than the competition is all that matters. Not being better than the competition 2 years ago. The pre-AI world is gone and not coming back. Readjust your expectations. Companies that think they'll be able to last with tiny headcounts are going to get crushed by the companies who choose to grow and force AI adoption across large teams.  Yes, there's a brief period where adoption hasn't fully hit yet, but once it has, the low water mark for productivity will adjust and you still need more people to build more product, unless you have some secret AI sauce that no one else has access to (indie solopreneur building saas products, that's not you!).
2025-05-03	Here's the counter point btw
2025-05-03	I’m tired of hearing the “AI is killing tech jobs” narrative. Here is data on “top” tech companies and startups hiring.

2025-05-03	Maybe I'm getting high on my own supply   But it might be that because of AI we'll now get this future of millions of solo founders (like indie hackers), lean teams and family businesses that all sell services and products to each other  Kinda like a village ecosystem of butcher, baker, smith but at a global scale  And mostly without funding cause why'd you need funding if letting AI work for you is so relatively cheap
2025-05-03	Tbh it will be the age of product people running almost everything themselves. SWEs will be fine because software is product or instrumental to the product's creation a lot of the time. You can't vibe your way to a good product no matter how good your AI tooling is.  There will be a lot of solo and family businesses. Career MBA C-suiter types and other non-product-touching admin positions you can successfully vibe and trivially outsource will gradually cease to exist and control will be more concentrated in founders (and their families/associates) with machines carrying out supporting work, freeing founders to focus on product and sales (if necessary for that particular product, since not everything really needs salesmanship).
2025-05-03	This is not a new idea for me  I kinda already thought this 10 years ago and I wrote a massive post about it and even was invited to Hungary to present it  This was way before AI and I didn't consider AI even but the post has aged well  I think I wrote how it'd be billions of "makers" and a few megacorps who'd own the servers  So it's same but the servers have GPUs to do AI training and inference  I think AI has made this future more likely  https://t.co/CoGcKiduiI  https://t.co/XePCD5LEsC

2025-05-03	⚡️ Power outages in Spain, Portugal, France this week and yesterday in Bali  Here's some stuff I can recommend to get to live through the next power outage, as we got through the outage in Portugal, but it might be anywhere in the world next, and it might take days, you never know, I feel we can increasingly depend less on public utilities and services, so good to prep a bit  📡 Starlink My biggest recommendation, the biggest issue we had during the outage wasn't missing power oddly, cause everything has batteries these days (phones, laptops) but it was internet. Without power we didn't have Starlink, and the 4G masts slowly run out of battery power too, so within 3 hours the internet was dead everywhere in Spain and Portugal. We had Starlink but we didn't have anything to power it, so couldn't use it, which brings me to the next thing:  🔋 EcoFlow 1kWh battery + 400W solar panel You charge it with electricity (when you get it) and then when there's an outage you can use it to plug it any electronics, like phone, laptops, Starlink. What's nice is you can buy it with a 400W solar panel, which if you have sun will let you charge it while power is down. Tip by @NorbertDragan   📻 Battery-powered radio (with USB-C) Without internet, you need a radio to figure out what the heck is going on. During the outage almost all Spanish and Portuguese radio stations became emergency radios and told what was going on. Very helpful. We listened in the car to see the status. Cause again without internet you don't know much.  ⛽️ Gasoline-powered generator This is optional cause you already have EcoFlow but in case shit really goes down for days, and you need more power, you can get this. I go the Denqbar DQ-2100 it gives 2100W with 55dB (not loud) and uses about 0.5L gasoline per hour at max, but much less if you use less power. Then get a 20L jerrycan of gasoline to fuel it.  🍖 Barbeque with gas Another thing we did NOT have but now will have. A gas barbecue with a big gas tank. A lot of big Weber barbecues have a separate gas stove @dwjorgeb recommended me which you can use to continue cooking. Most new houses esp in Europe come with an electric stove, ours too, so without power we couldn't cook anymore. Even with a battery we'd have to dismount the stove because all the electric cabling is built in. So having a gas barbeque is a big benefit I think  💦 20-40L of drinkable water One of the next things that will go after the power goes out for days will be the water pressure people told me. So it makes sense to have about 20-40L of water I heard. First thing we did when power went out was buy more water. You can survive without food for quite a while, without water not very long!  💵 Get lots of cash out When power went out remarkably in Portugal we could still go to the supermarket and pay with cards, well, for a few hours, at some point that went down too. And everything switched to cash. Luckily we had some cash left in the car because without it the supermarkets would literally not let you buy anything! Worse is that ALL the ATMs we went were out of money! So you need a stash of cash. Find a ATM that takes out a lot and take out money 20 times, it's annoying but now you have a cash backup.  🔫 Home defense This varies by country in what is legal to get. But I recommend you get some stuff to defend your home in case shit goes down. After 48 hours of no power apparently societies turn into an anarchy. So just in case, get some stuff to defend yourself.  ⏰ Long term Long term if you have a home, it's good to get solar and some big home batteries. One Tesla Powerwall is 13.5kWh, so that's like 13.5x EcoFlows 1kWh's. So if you get two of those that's a lot of power and you can go for about a week, more even if you have sun and solar.  Anyway hope this helps, I'm not a prepper but wanna be ready for the next one 😊

2025-05-03	Software development jobs dropped 10% year over year from April 2024 to April 2025  At this rate in 5 years that means almost half of the dev jobs we have now gone which seems fitting with AI taking over a lot of the dev work
2025-05-03	Tech hiring is dead and it's not coming back I think https://t.co/pvhSR1UyDB
2025-05-03	Start a business today  Don't hire people but use AI to build and run it very lean: low costs + high profit margins   Time of software dev employment will increasingly be over I think  It might not be right now immediately but progressively more over next 5 years!
2025-05-03	@levelsio Só what do we do?
2025-05-03	Realistically I think most tech jobs are  a thing of the past with AI to be honest  Right now we're seeing hiring stops everywhere, next will be layoffs I think  What will remain is tech founders who build things with entire AI teams which @shl says too and I believe he's right  You'd be better off going into construction and building IRL things than coding right now UNLESS you want to start your own tech business where you use AI to build it  I think corporations will need 10x to 100x less devs than they have now once they're augmented by AI  No idea about timeline and nobody can predict but within next 5 years I think this will slowly happen and again I'm seeing it from Remote OK  inb4 "no it's just your site that has a drop bro" ye ye

I tinker but I am not a web dev by background, so besides the app, I was very interested in what it's like to vibe code a full web app today. As such, I wrote none of the code directly (Cursor+Claude/o3 did) and I don't really know how the app works, in the conventional sense that I'm used to as an engineer.  The app is called MenuGen, and it is live on https://t.co/bQonQT88t0. Basically I'm often confused about what all the things on a restaurant menu are - e.g. Pâté, Tagine, Cavatappi or Sweetbread (hint it's... not sweet). Enter MenuGen: you take a picture of a menu and it generates images for all the menu items and presents them in a nice list. I find it super useful to get a quick visual sense of the menu.  But the more interesting part for me I thought was the exploration of vibe coding around how easy/hard it is to build and deploy a full web app today if you are not a web developer. So I wrote up the full blog post on my experience here, including some takeaways: https://t.co/2kkQh0ElgB  Copy pasting just the TLDR: "Vibe coding menugen was exhilarating and fun escapade as a local demo, but a bit of a painful slog as a deployed, real app. Building a modern app is a bit like assembling IKEA future. There are all these services, docs, API keys, configurations, dev/prod deployments, team and security features, rate limits, pricing tiers... Meanwhile the LLMs have slightly outdated knowledge of everything, they make subtle but critical design mistakes when you watch them closely, and sometimes they hallucinate or gaslight you about solutions. But the most interesting part to me was that I didn't even spend all that much work in the code editor itself. I spent most of it in the browser, moving between tabs and settings and configuring and gluing a monster. All of this work and state is not even accessible or manipulatable by an LLM - how are we supposed to be automating society by 2027 like this?"  See the post for full detail, and maybe give MenuGen a go the next time you're at a restaurant!

2025-05-02	@robj3d3 Open the cover, you can just pull it open  Then slide out the filter  See how dirty it is  You can shower that  Only have the pipes and outside machine to clean then (ask hotel)
2025-05-02	VERY common  And that always means your AC is dirty and you need to clean it (both inside and outside unit and the pipes)  Cold temperature does NOT make you sick, dirty ACs make you sick and most ACs are dirty (esp in Airbnbs)  Open the cover and wash the filter in the shower
2025-05-02	@levelsio After seeing your post the other day, I turned my A/C down to 18°C  Next day woke up with a dry throat and have been nasally congested since  How do you do it? My body can't handle that cold  and I also have northern European genes
2025-05-02	😴 We have construction at the house now and they had to nuke some tubes so our bedroom AC would not work anymore  That meant the bedroom went from normally 🥶 18°C / 64°F to near 🥵 22°C / 72°F (+4°C / +8°F)  Small difference but as you can see from the crashing sleep score with a big impact  The last 2 nights we moved to the other bedroom where the AC still works and I sleep great again  Cold (and dark) bedroom really is the biggest thing for my sleep at least
2025-04-27	How I get 100% perfect sleep:  - very cold bedroom 18-20°C / 64-68°F (colder better) - 9kg weighted blanket by CURA (adjust to your bodyweight) - separate duvet from gf (I do this for years this might be the biggest sleep improvement) - 3M ear plugs (I tried Ohropax wax but they only half as silent) - eye mask - red LED lights that go on before sleep in bedroom - 0.2mg melatonin 45min before sleep then dim the lights (melatonin is ALWAYS sold in too high dose like 3mg, it should be 10x less or it doesn't work!) - 4x per week cardio + strength training, my resting heart rate (RHR) is 52 - mostly clean diet of meat + vegetables + fruit + black coffee + sparkling water with lemon (and sometimes cheat with dark choco), not a lot of carbs (almost never pasta or regular potatoes for ex but sometimes rice or sweet potatoes) - healthy biomarkers and body mass index, if you're overweight it WILL affect your sleep usually with sleep apnea etc - read phone before sleep but with Smart Invert on and my custom super dark hack using iOS Zoom (but it doesn't zoom it just decreases brightness even further), then read Kindle a bit to really make me sleepy 😂 - we try avoid eating after 10pm, and we sleep around midnight to 1am, especially sweet stuff like fruits seem to have a bad effect on my sleep - also DO not drink 2-3 hours before sleep or you wake up to go pee (which is more common when you get older) - disclaimer: no kids (yet) so easy talking  Other things:  Temperature seems to be the biggest impact for me, if it gets too hot I wake up and once I wake up my brain gets active and it's sometimes hard to fall asleep. I already had this years ago and thought it was stress but even if I have life stuff going along I can sleep solid 8h without waking up if it's just a very cold bedroom.  If it's really super cold like 17-18°C / 62-64°FI just never wake up  For that you need a thick duvet though and your gf needs thicker cause women are generally colder  If you're culturally used to sleeping hotter, consider changing that because it seems to benefit almost anyone to sleep colder! An AC will do the trick.  As @bryan_johnson tells everyone, sleep is the most important thing to prioritize for your health  Good sleep benefits all your health markers, your immune system and so stops you from getting sick. Even cleaning your brain of plaque to avoid dementia when you're older

It won’t be long until AI will be writing all the code for Helper, Flexile, and Gumroad. My guess is by the end of 2026.  Our new process:  1. Sit and chat about what we need to build, doing research with Deep Research as we go. 2. Have AI record everything and turn it into a spec.  3. Clean up the spec, adding any design requirements / other nuances. 4. Have Devin code it up. 5. QA, merge, (auto-)deploy to prod.

2025-04-23	📣 The winners of the 2025 Vibe Code Game Jam sponsored by @boltdotnew + @coderabbitai +  @lambdaapi from over 1,000+ games submitted are...  ....as judged by @karpathy @timsoret @mrdoob @s13k_ and me  🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  #1 🏆 $10,000 The Great Taxi Assignment by @TomasBencko  Play it 👉 https://t.co/EI2q8ItYnf A fun GTA-like taxi driver simulator  The jury said: "I love it, it's funny, cute, well executed, cool music, great, potential winner" "Fun game - Single Player GTA style picking up people and dropping them off. You can run them over too. A little bit too easy." "Crazy taxi, cool vibes, great car physics, feels good, instant fun, level design a bit flat"  🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  #2 🥈 $5,000 Vibeware by @mattgordonxyz  Play it 👉 https://t.co/tuF3L0EgTr  The jury said: "Much fun" "Super fun concept lol. you're a bot and given tasks. i like that it's original idea and looks relatively polished" "Fun concept, but janky"  🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  #3 🥉 $2,500 Vector Tango by @scobelverse  Play it 👉 https://t.co/Dz3851uyBr  The jury said: "Looks pretty clean/polished, air traffic ocntrol simulator" "Looks good, but elevation control (A/Z) is unconvenient"  🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  💖 Thanks to the judges for judging all the games, thanks to the sponsors, thanks to EVERYONE for making all these amazing games!  In the next few days all the games will go live on the site and get connected in the giant Vibeverse with portals!  It was a blast organizing this and after the plane game went viral I think it was a great way to get more distribution for everyone else and get their games played too  Vibe coding still has its limitations but it seems clear that we're all on to something, as the vast majority of people participating never made a game before! That's refreshing and allows new people to enter industries they've never been in before. AI is opening up a lot of creativity and I think that's super exciting! 😊
2025-04-23	🏆 The winners of the 2025 Vibe Code Game Jam sponsored by @boltdotnew + @coderabbitai + @lambdaapi will be announced today at 7 PM UTC!  1st prize: 🏆 $10,000 2nd prize: 🥈 $5,000 3rd prize: 🥉 $2,500  I put the countdown on the site now and redesigned it to show the winners 😊  And adding ALL the 1000+ games to the game directory now too so you can browse them on the site tonight (link in reply) and they'll all get a backlink  Sorry it took a bit, everything was new for me. Next year if we do it again it will be a bit more streamlined now that I know how to organize this, essentially vibe organized it :D
2025-04-30	All winners are paid out now! https://t.co/t0K68fhst6
2025-04-30	I think we reached the limit where AI stops understanding large code bases so you can't vibe code anymore  And you have to do targeted AI edits like CMD+K in Cursor  That makes it not vibey after the first prototype and you get stuck  Then the codebase is worse than if you wrote it manually  So we need AI to get better so we can continue vibe coding more which I think will happen any moment seeing how fast progress goes with AI
2025-04-30	Are vibe-coded games mostly dead now?

2025-04-29	It seems gummies from creatine to melatonine have big quality issues  Someone tested creatine gummies and found they barely contained any creatine  I take 0.21mg melatonin gummies and sometimes they don't work (for both me and gf) and also fluctuate in taste, I don't trust those either  I think best to avoid gummies also cause they contain artificial sweeteners which isn't great for your gut flora  Just get the pill or powder IMHO
2025-04-29	@levelsio I got so scammed by my creatine gummies bought on Amazon. They claim 5000mg in 2 gummies. Then after  a month I realized 2 gummies actually weight 5 grams and are supposed to have 4 grams of https://t.co/Oydofpem4w I will be lucky if there is even 1 gram in them. https://t.co/dXTjr2a0f2

2025-04-29	💯   This seems the thing  If you have a group of people you're tight with like our little village community you can help each other out  Individual prepping is nice but without community you'll be eaten alive ☠️

2025-04-29	How about no? :D https://t.co/q0LF8O1Cwu
2025-04-29	My theory: The best prepping (besides the basics: water, essential meds etc) is building a strong community.  If things go south for more than a few days, your best chance is organizing, working together, and make the most of everyone’s skills.
2025-04-29	Prepping is nice but also a fallacy  If you do have your shit in order and everyone but you runs out of resources  Everyone will just storm your compound and actually higher risk of dying cause they'll murder you for resources
2025-04-29	@levelsio That why I’m building a backup village with some friends we want to have 30 house autonomous. In case of shit hit the fan too much :)
2025-04-29	Things we got that we should have had before: - big backup camping battery (I bought an Ecoflow now) - then can hook up Starlink to that for internet cause internet/phone disappeared fast and u really want connectivity (this was worse than not having power actually) - FM radio (tried to get all sold out) - water (we got but was quickly sold out) - freezer full of meat (we had just finished most) - bbq + coals
2025-04-29	⚡️ Power came back  But I don't trust it at all because it came back at night and went down again this morning  So we're charging everything before it goes down again  I was already building a self sufficient fortress but yesterday definitely proved we have to ramp that up with big batteries and solar  This was the worst blackout in European history, and I don't wanna be clickbait guy but I think that happening in modern Europe and then taking almost 24 hours to fix says something, yeah yeah Southern Europe, but it's still Europe!  Increasingly we can't depend on government services or public utilities in Europe anymore while we pay higher prices and taxes for it than anywhere else in the world  The fact that we lost 4G, internet and phone lines in just hours is kinda crazy too, just zero communication lines  With most modern homes having electric stoves, you're really F'd too when power goes down cause you can't cook  So yes great reminder to become a prepper even more as @thekitze says  I was already going 100% off grid but this will speed it up! A great warning for when shit will hit the fan even more in the future
2025-04-29	Good morning ☀️   Power came back at 1am then went down again at 7am  Now we're without power again  Some friends here have power, others don't, we're near Lisbon  It seems now the issue is in Portugal only and getting local areas up again  Time to make coffee 😆 https://t.co/4TZTxiIHXU

2025-04-28	Power and internet still down!  Right after this tweet below the diesel generators at Continente shut down, the internet went down and then the entire electronic payment network went down  We had to find cash in the car to pay for the groceries  4G has been down since then with absolutely no internet  Just a few minutes ago it came back so I can tweet this  We're cooking with candle lights but we also bought coal and a barbeque as a backup  The Tesla is great cause we can charge our phones and it has FM radio, so we can hear what the Portuguese stations say  Right now we listen Portugal parliament having a live streamed public crisis meeting  The town is almost pitch black except for the few homes with solar + battery! At least we can see the stars now ✨
2025-04-28	Most water and canned food is already sold out in our Portugal supermarket  Portuguese are fast to scavenge as they should be if power doesn't come back soon 🥸  It all feels very COVID 2020 to everyone here  The fact supermarkets are still up with generators is great work by the Portuguese
2025-04-28	In the big supermarkets in Portugal you can hear the massive diesel generators in the back running! ⛽️ 💨  ⚡️ https://t.co/IOfo2GjPnX
2025-04-28	Power still down in Spain and Portugal  All internet is gone too cause the 4G masts ran out of battery power, at least in Portugal, don't know Spain  Phone calls don't even work anymore!  Also I heard many gas stations in Portugal can't pump gasoline cause their pumps work on electricity  Only internet we have is in the Continente supermarket which I'm typing this on 😂  We went to buy an analog battery radio at Radio Popular and they're all sold out already! 📻
2025-04-28	Power is STILL down  That makes it I think the worst blackout in Europe since 2006 and maybe longer  We're in Portugal and went to supermarket to get water and food in case power doesn't come back (small chance but already hours now)  Absolute anarchy ala COVID 2020 there  Internet progressively went from 5G to 4G then 3G then 2G then nothing at all progressively, it seems the telecom masts have a battery for just a few hours  Anyway everyone's buying water, food and toilet paper  ATMs are all empty of cash money   Funny we drove past some guys working on an electricity mast, maybe they didn't get the news it's entire Spain and Portugal? 😂

2025-04-24	Today I had to upgrade my electricity in Portugal so I had to call the electricity company EDP  After much hassle they finally agreed to upgrade it but said "I will now send you a contract by email to sign"  I didn't get anything so I said "what email did you sent it?"  She answered "I cannot tell you what email I sent it to because of personal data protection laws"  ???  😂😂😂
2025-04-28	Power down in whole Portugal and Spain? My power down too
2025-04-28	I was gonna get solar and batteries, but now I really gonna get them ASAP, can't rely on the grid :D @dvassallo

2025-04-28	Great point  Benefits of Euro were mostly when traveling, you didn't have to exchange money  Now we all pay digital anyway so it's the same card or phone tap  Which gives us even less reason to keep the Euro for Southern Europe  I think they should fork it into the Seuro  Float it freely separate from the Euro so it can crash down and make Southern Europe cheaper so demand increases and businesses and jobs come back
2025-04-28	@levelsio Euro only works great united  states of europe.  Now works but not great. Still dont dislike having to avoid changing currency.  But with more digital less of an issue
2025-04-28	In a way Poland narrowly escaped death by keeping their own currency and that's why they're doing so well now  I'm pro-EU btw but the Euro has made poor countries poorer and rich countries richer  The problem is poor countries can't become cheaper with low demand and balance out their trade because they're fixed to the same currency as the rich countries  Without Euro: Low demand -> currency drops -> country becomes cheaper -> more demand for products -> more jobs  With Euro: Low demand -> absolutely nothing happens unless it's low demand on a European scale

I already had this years ago and thought it was stress but even if I have life stuff going along I can sleep solid 8h without waking up if it's just a very cold bedroom.  If it's really super cold like 17-18°C / 62-64°FI just never wake up  For that you need a thick duvet though and your gf needs thicker cause women are generally colder  If you're culturally used to sleeping hotter, consider changing that because it seems to benefit almost anyone to sleep colder! An AC will do the trick.

2025-04-26	The only thing young people in Southern Europe can do is drink and smoke because there's absolutely zero opportunities for them to do anything else  They have little to no economic opportunities available, no jobs, no housing to rent or buy to move out of your parent's place and regulation makes it close to impossible to even run your own business  The only thing you can do is hope you can leave and work abroad and then return at age 65 when you've made enough money and buy some farmland  Their governments have failed their people for decades  Tragic is what it is  But yes it's a "vibe"

2025-04-26	Yep apparently massive chat groups where they would like and reply each other's posts with AI generated replies  To receive X ad rev share  Considering most of us now went up 4x in payouts means they were taking 75% of our payouts before!
2025-04-26	@levelsio I think they are cracking down on all the Indian dudes who were posting crap like "coffee or tea" and engaging with each other's stuff to farm engagement.
2025-04-26	Apparently this revenue spike for all of us is because X stopped paying out engagement farmers  Aka threadbois?

2025-04-25	Fully synthetic AI influencers now got an update on Photo AI  They're now fully consistent, meaning they don't change in looks, and are real consistent characters now  Before I used prompts to define them which resulted in more variations in output  But now what I do: - User designs the AI influencer based on looks - Robot generates photos for that look with a prompt - Robot uses Instant Character to generate 20 consistent looking training photos and put it into a ZIP - Robot upscales all those pcis - Robot then actually trains that ZIP as an AI model as if it was a real human using the site  It works pretty well, I still have some issue with vertical scanlines at higher resos now on @FAL that they're fixing that you might see  And the skin ofc still isn't there yet, which is more pronounced with Instant Character which is not super high quality  But it's cool cause now you can create CONSISTENT characters that don't exist
2025-02-10	AI influencers are quickly starting to become big business now  🇺🇸 American AI influencer @lilmiquela makes $10 million per year  🇩🇪 German AI fashion model @noonoouri makes $500,000 per year  🇿🇦 South African AI supermodel Shudu makes $2,000 per sponsored post  Last year the industry was valued at $6 billion and by 2030 it's projected to grow to $45 billion in money spent by people on virtual influencers  A LOT of people asked me to make it possible to create their own AI Influencer from scratch  So this week I've added this ability to Photo AI  You can design your AI influencer based on where they're from, how they look, etc. then once you created it, you can take photos and videos with them and even make them talk  This AI influencer below does not exist and was made with Photo AI in 30 seconds for example:
2025-04-25	✨ Live now on Photo AI:  @OpenAI's new image editing model  Here I asked it "change my hoodie to a holographic transparent jacket"  It works pretty well, but like Gemini does affect and distort the face a bit, which you can fix if you [ Remix ] it after again  Nice to see OpenAI open up more of their features in the API 😊
2025-04-24	So I copy pasted screenshots of Photo AI's Stripe dashboard to ChatGPT and asked it  > How I can make more money?  And it told me to chase failed payments  My payment recovery rate is 20%, Stripe says the average should be 40%  So I've added a webhook catcher that gets invoice.payment_failed, sets the user as in_recovery=true  They get an email with a link to pay their last invoice in @Stripe's customer portal and inside the app lots of alerts to pay it too  Once THAT invoice is paid, Stripe saves the new payment details to pay for the next subscription renewal, and I essentially saved the customer from auto churning due to failed payment reasons like expired cards etc.  Will report back how this improves revenue recovery!

2025-04-23	✨ Vibe coded my own $4.99/mo socal media screenshot service in 2 hours in Node JS  Before I paid ~$500/mo for screenshots because I have a lot of sites and I like to use screenshots as social media images for every single page like user profiles, job posts, cities, photo packs on Photo AI, and even filter combinations for tags on Nomads and Remote OK  I'm a PHPboi, so I never coded anything in full JS on the server and honestly wouldn't even know where to start without AI but with Cursor it was pretty easy  It's called "url2og . com" because you input a URL and you get an Open Graph image for social media back  I switched all my sites to it now and it generates 104,480 screenshots per day, so over 3 million screenshots per month  It runs on Express with Node with PM2 on a $4.99/mo Hetzner VPS isolated on its own server for safety, it uses Puppeteer and Chromium to take screenshots, supports Apple emojis, and uses BullMQ as a queue system  Again I have no idea how a lot of this works or if I did the right thing but it DOES work properly so it's deployed to all my sites 😊

2025-04-23	RT @sobedominik: Four years ago I was walking through 🇵🇹 Ericeira with $200 in my account, a $100 MRR SaaS, and no clue what I was doing.   My parents were nudging me to get a “real” job.  Instead, I bought myself one more year to figure it out and everything changed.  I was about to graduate from my Bachelor’s. I had no job lined up, and time was running out. I studied Economics but taught myself how to code on the side. I immediately knew I’m not meant to work for someone and that I want to do my own thing.  So I did what any desperate student might do:  I enrolled in a Master’s.  Not for the degree but as an excuse to delay getting a job and go all-in on building something profitable.  During that year, while most of my classmates were partying or traveling, I split my time: 30% on uni, 70% on trying to bootstrap a business.  I barely saw anyone. Full focus. No parties, declined dozens of invitations Was it healthy? Definitely not. But I’m glad I shut out the world and just built.  If you are in your 20ies you should do the same. Even in your 30ies what is one year of sacrifice worth to you? Perhaps a completely different live who knows.  Most ideas failed. But eventually, one stuck:  A Notion-powered help center SaaS I built @HelpkitHQ   It started making enough to support me post-uni. And that was all I needed to double down and keep going.  I’ve never had a “real” job in my life. And I’m incredibly grateful it all worked out.  Definitely made sacrifices but I’d do it all over again.  Now I’m back walking through Ericeira again and I’m in a much better place than I ever imagined.  I’m nowhere near rich yet but life could be way worse.  I get to build internet products and live fully location independent wherever I want.   Curious what will happen next time I’ll walk here again.

You can run them over too. A little bit too easy." "Crazy taxi, cool vibes, great car physics, feels good, instant fun, level design a bit flat"  🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  #2 🥈 $5,000 Vibeware by @mattgordonxyz  Play it 👉 https://t.co/tuF3L0EgTr  The jury said: "Much fun" "Super fun concept lol. you're a bot and given tasks. i like that it's original idea and looks relatively polished" "Fun concept, but janky"  🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  #3 🥉 $2,500 Vector Tango by @scobelverse  Play it 👉 https://t.co/Dz3851uyBr  The jury said: "Looks pretty clean/polished, air traffic ocntrol simulator" "Looks good, but elevation control (A/Z) is unconvenient"  🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  💖 Thanks to the judges for judging all the games, thanks to the sponsors, thanks to EVERYONE for making all these amazing games!  In the next few days all the games will go live on the site and get connected in the giant Vibeverse with portals!  It was a blast organizing this and after the plane game went viral I think it was a great way to get more distribution for everyone else and get their games played too  Vibe coding still has its limitations but it seems clear that we're all on to something, as the vast majority of people participating never made a game before! That's refreshing and allows new people to enter industries they've never been in before. AI is opening up a lot of creativity and I think that's super exciting! 😊
2025-04-23	🏆 The winners of the 2025 Vibe Code Game Jam sponsored by @boltdotnew + @coderabbitai + @lambdaapi will be announced today at 7 PM UTC!  1st prize: 🏆 $10,000 2nd prize: 🥈 $5,000 3rd prize: 🥉 $2,500  I put the countdown on the site now and redesigned it to show the winners 😊  And adding ALL the 1000+ games to the game directory now too so you can browse them on the site tonight (link in reply) and they'll all get a backlink  Sorry it took a bit, everything was new for me. Next year if we do it again it will be a bit more streamlined now that I know how to organize this, essentially vibe organized it :D

2025-04-23	AI lets my try different tech stacks  For the plane game it helped me write a fully Python game server that scaled really well  For this url2og project it's JS with Node with Express etc  It's fun cause I can just learn it by putting it in practice immediately  For someone usually writing PHP + jQuery that's pretty cool 😎
2025-04-23	@levelsio Any reason why you're branching out to so many different tech stacks these days?

2025-04-23	✨ Every page on all of my sites has a screenshot for og:image social media cards  Remote OK has 1.7 million user profiles, millions of job filter combo pages (like /remote-php+jquery-jobs), Nomads has millions of filter combo pages pages too (like /safe-cities-with-fast-internet) etc.  If you have an og:image for your pages, you get more clicks and make more money because sharing the page shows as a giant image block instead of just a text link!
2025-04-23	@levelsio Just out of curiosity: what are you then doing with the 104,480 screenshots per day?
2025-04-15	✨ Day 13 of judging the 2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam sponsored by @boltdotnew + @coderabbitai + @LambdaAPI   All the  jury votes are in finally!  Now I am merging the scores to find the winners...  I tried it with ChatGPT first but I don't wanna trust it with it yet so I wrote a script in PHP to match the game URLs and scores properly  I'll open source the script with the scores when announcing the winners of course!
2025-04-23	Winners will show on the site in a few hours! https://t.co/j7LXaWzd8r

2025-04-21	@levelsio Once FSD hits globally, Uber may die unless they integrate
2025-04-21	Also Uber became so bad outside US  I had to permadelete it after years  Uber drivers in Europe are like the bottom of the barrel, most good drivers already left the app  And Uber is squeezing the remaining drivers so hard they can barely survive resulting in very stressed out (and often drugged out) drivers  Not safe  For deliveries in Portugal/Spain I prefer Glovo now  Kinda big deal for me cause I was one of their top users for about a decade, spent thousands on Uber per month, but it completely went to shit once they started turning a profit  In my opinion they should have just raised prices and paid their drivers well but they decided to do the opposite and squeeze drivers to the max possible  Not good for the drivers, not good for customers and long term not good for Uber

2025-04-20	I don't think immigrants anywhere should have any access to social welfare until they've paid into the system at the same level  I'm an immigrant and I should have the right to social welfare in the country I am born (Netherlands) not where I move to (Portugal)  Until I've paid enough in taxes that pulling social welfare is still a net positive for my host country  You shouldn't be able to just arrive in a new country and start taking unemployment or disability or pension benefits or get free housing, no logic to that  You should be able to arrive and find a house and a job and make money though   Which works if a country has made it easy to build enough new homes and start enough new businesses to provide housing and work for its people and the immigrants arriving  Few countries now do though!

2025-04-20	✨ You can now train a new AI model of yourself in just 90 seconds (before it took 2 hours) on Photo AI  I rolled out a very high quality version of the super fast Flux trainer on Photo AI now  I always tried to train with the highest steps possible (like 3500), because it gets you the highest resemblance (likeness to the person)  But that always took more time and cost more but that made Photo AI's resemblance and photo quality usually better than most other sites that cheap out and do like 500 to 1000 steps  2 hours was always quite long for that training though, but now it looks like the quality is actually identical with a 90 second training  Live for all Premium and Ultra subscribers  Thanks @FAL for doing amazing engineering work here, no clue how they did it  🏎️ 80x faster!

2025-04-20	RT @yishan: There's a perspective that most people in the West don't realize about China.  Every kid in China grows up knowing that they're part of a 5000-year-old civilization.  You hear this a lot but it's not obvious the effect it has on you.  What it means is that even if you're a bunch of peasants right NOW, your people have always had civilization.  The civilizations aren't perfect or eternal - they rise and fall when the rulers get corrupt and stupid - but civilization is part of the fate of your people, almost the natural default state of things.  Even when it's fallen, it's always come back, because that's how your people DO things.  It's like knowing your family has been rich for generations and you're just in one of the down periods.  That's different from having been poor and primitive from the beginning of time.  It means that Chinese people internalize a default notion of "yeah, we have a civilization, it's just a down period right now, but eventually another strong leader will come about, we'll all work hard, and our civilization will rise again as it has dozens and dozens of times throughout history."  Westerners looked at China in the past 100-200 years as a primitive society like all the others, having always been primitive.  But no, for most Chinese history, China was the world-leading civilization and Chinese people know that.  So any emergence of a leader (like Mao, who unified the country) was a thing Chinese people expected, because that's happened before.  And then once it transitioned to Deng, and material conditions started to improve, it was a familiar pattern, like "oh look, China is rising again, if we work hard and educate our youth, we will  be a top-tier civilization, we just had some bad times for a while."  It is a matter of society-wide inherent expectations.  Chinese people don't think of their current trajectory as "rising," they think of it was "getting back up" because they've been here dozens of times before.  The distinction is important.  Now to answer the direct question:  Inherent in this "we're getting back up" is the idea that "all we have to do" is work hard at long-term plans.  It's not communism or American manufacturing - those are surface elements - it's Chinese history and culture.  One thing I've learned over my own life is that if you have never witnessed or successfully executed a long-term plan, you are likely to not have the motivation to work on one, because you don't have the same kind of hands-on faith that it will succeed.    I was lucky in my youth to work for a boss who was executing a long-term project plan (years long) and watched that as I and other students executed his long list of tasks one by one that the whole thing actually came together.  It helped me understand very early in my career that you can make a big plan, break it down, and then patiently execute each portion and see it eventually come to fruition.  The West has less experience like that (on a generational scale).  In the 1970s and 80s, China embarked on the long road to industrializing itself.  It realized that to regain national strength, it would have to slowly, in sequence, acquire the skills and industrial capabilities needed to produce and develop technologically advanced industries that underpin and support a modern nation.  So they started doing it, entrusting the ongoing task to each generation of leaders who also understood what it took.  These days, people often say, "it'll take 20 years to get manufacturing started again in the US."  And the inherent unspoken response to that is, "oh man, that's too long, I guess we're sunk."  But the Chinese response is, "Okay, better start working on it then and we'll have it in 20 years."  Because every Chinese person has internalized the idea that that's just how it goes!  That's how civilization always rises again after it fell.  Chinese people in 1980 were not primitives who needed to be "led" to advancement, they knew what a civilization looks like.  They know how governance works, how a civil service needed to administer a huge country works, and they knew that you educate your people, work hard, build industry, and then you can build everything else - and this works at any time in history, at any level of technology.  I'm trying to express this deep idea of "they always knew it was in their blood, because it was part of their history."  There is a deep sense of historical inevitability which enables China to simply get to work and know that it'll get where it's going.  The closest analog to this in Western culture is something like the Roman Empire, and that's why "men always think about the Roman Empire."  But the direct linkage is weaker, because there isn't a direct linguistic or cultural line from the Roman Empire (except for Italians specifically).  There is enough of one that the West thinks of its ancient predecessor as Rome, then European empires up to the UK, and then the US.  But in China, the historical linkage is stronger - it's always been China.  China rises and falls, sometimes it collapses and falls, or get invaded and beaten up, but leaders always re-emerge to unite the people and rebuild their civilization.  And this is why, in the 1980s, China's leaders said, "Oh, I guess we're going to need a modern navy if we're to keep other nations from bullying us, so I guess we're going to have to learn to build modern ships, and that's going to take decades, so I guess we'll have to start the first step and learn to make steel."  The Chinese people are not submissive fools being kept down by authoritarian dictators (like the West thinks), they are people who know that that's how it always goes, and what it takes, and what the ultimate rewards are for their children, and that's why the country is going the way it is.

2025-04-19	Immigrants in Portugal are just the scapegoat for a dysfunctional government and corrupt system that doesn't build housing, makes it impossible for Portuguese to start or run businesses  This means no jobs created so no job opportunities for them, and no houses built so no places to live for them. Which results in most young Portuguese leaving the country at age 18-25  Before the scapegoat was the digital nomads, and before that the Brazilians. Now it's the South Asian immigrants  Portuguese love to blame foreigners for the problems their own government has created  Every problem in Portugal is an extreme version of Europe's problems as a whole btw
2025-04-20	It's not Europe or US or any other country's job to save the entire world population  It simply can't afford that  It'll bankrupt the West  Nor does anyone outside the West do that?  You think I can fly to Thailand get unemployment benefits? 😂😂😂

2025-04-19	I still see regular people have no clue how we use AI to code  They think it's like AI Agents and lots of hype bs  But for me most of it isn't very difficult or deep or fancy but it's simply A LOT of autocompleting and prediction now  Small things like this a few mins ago:  Nomad List's weather API robot that pulls the weather every day to show on the site, sometimes it hits an error on the API side, and it sends that to my Telegram  Then I wanna know "ok for what city is it erroring?"  The moment I just put my cursor on "Bad API reply" it already knows what I want and autocompletes to "Bad API reply for city $city['name']" which will tell me for example "Bad API reply for Bangkok"  Basic stuff like that saves me a lot of seconds and minutes in a day and it adds up!

2025-04-19	🧪 Open sourced my biomarkers and now put them on https://t.co/m7hF4oljmI  Just like having thousands of eyes on my startups helps me improve them, I think same with my biomarkers  Generally I'm pretty fit and healthy with low inflammatory markers (CRP)  I started doing blood work tests in 2016 I think in Bangkok because @joerogan kept talking about it   And I like how @bryan_johnson is pushing more people to get their blood work tested and take this seriously and open sourcing his too  It's often hard to find doctors to do blood tests, they won't let you, so you're better of finding private clinics to do it  ChatGPT is a great way to interpret your results btw!
2024-11-26	🧪 Went for a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) yesterday  VO2Max went up from 🟥 28 (very bad) to 🟩 42 (good)  I did a Bruce test 2 years ago in Thailand and my cardio was pretty bad the cardiologist said cause I only lifted weights  Since then I've added ~15min cycling to my workouts 4x per week  Bruce is a diff test but it does have a formula to deduce VO2Max and it was 28, not sure how accurate though, def not good back then and good now  My goal would be a VO2Max of 45 to 50 which is excellent I think  So have to add a bit more cardio to the workouts to get there:  🧪 Added to my biomarkers:  https://t.co/o5QSC8eYwH
2025-04-19	Can Portuguese explain how this works?
2025-04-19	@oalexdoda @levelsio Unfortunately there is not strict regulation and you have foreigners getting 800€ per month of social support while Portuguese families receive maximum 200€ and have very bad conditions.
2025-04-19	I do feel European governments see getting lots of immigrants in as a way to resolve the untenable problem they have:  - Not enough new people born - Too many old people  There's not enough people born to pay for the existing pensions and healthcare systems  Flooding a country with foreign workers increases tax income to pay for those, but it only helps to delay the collapse of the social systems for a bit  Long term you get the issues of integrating immigrants, which in Europe can clash with your own culture, and abuse of social systems which causes net negative income which you see in large parts of Europe now

2025-04-19	Immigrants in Portugal are just the scapegoat for a dysfunctional government and corrupt system that doesn't build housing, makes it impossible for Portuguese to start or run businesses  This means no jobs created so no job opportunities for them, and no houses built so no places to live for them. Which results in most young Portuguese leaving the country at age 18-25  Before the scapegoat was the digital nomads, and before that the Brazilians. Now it's the South Asian immigrants  Portuguese love to blame foreigners for the problems their own government has created  Every problem in Portugal is an extreme version of Europe's problems as a whole btw

2025-04-17	I had a moment yesterday where I realized I get to build things for startups at @stripe 🤯  In 2008, building around online payments was on hard mode. I somehow built a marketplace. Scaled to 6M+ users. Sold it.   I wish I had Stripe back then.   In 2020, things got easy peasy. I built @lmsqueezy all with the help of Stripe. Sold it.  In 2025, I can’t believe I’m now on the other side — building shiny, new things (*cough* MoR) at Stripe.  It got me thinking, what else should we (@stripe) build for startups? 🤔
2025-04-18	My business life is essentially me wanting to deal with less and less different companies  Because it means less complexity  I like to get my payments with Stripe, ideally pay my bills with Stripe too, pay Digital Ocean for server and FAL for GPU, then send myself dividends to Revolut  4 companies to deal with is nice and simple  Right now it's a bit more than that

2025-04-17	RT @chamath: I had a child “diagnosed” with ADHD several years ago. The immediate reaction of the people involved was to prescribe drugs.   We refused.   Absolutely under no circumstances were we going to let our pre-pubescent child take amphetamines which is what these ADHD drugs are.   More generally, I found the diagnosis process shoddy, the availability of resources for my child (tutors, executive function help etc) to be scattered and expensive and the desire of the school to “solve” the problem lazy and reductive (sit alone, go take tests in a separate place, have more time on assignments and feel isolated from peers).   It can’t be the case that so many of our kids have ADHD and are then put through this.  I find it more plausible that economic incentives drove an entire industry to spring up around an FDA approved drug that, looking back, mostly doesn’t work. People make money diagnosing it, tutoring around it, coaching around it, etc etc   This has done decades of damage to kids.   Here is a summary from Grok of a great article in the NYT.   https://t.co/sD4QRSIGLx

It’s a good deal for me, and it should only bring more benefits to the community.  Details  - $3.6M sale price.  - 50% cash / 50% stock options.  - Cash payment in 2 parts: $900K received last week, $900K in 12 months.  - My options vest in 10% increments every 6 months.  - I will continue to run Small Bets for 5 years. If I quit, I lose any unvested options.  - I will also be helping part-time to make Gumroad better.  - I won't take any salary*. My goal is to help Gumroad (the company) become a $10M profit/yr business and make my equity return a $200K+/yr dividend.  * technically my state of WA is forcing Gumroad to pay me a minimum wage of $69,500/yr, but I’ll use that to exercise my options.  Valuation  - Gumroad had already acquired 10% of Small Bets last year for $500K.  - $3.6M for 90% = $4M valuation.  - Small Bets made almost $500K in profit last year excluding Gumroad fees. Based on 2024 earnings, this sale would represent an 8X profit multiple. Under the Gumroad umbrella, we expect to grow this business to $1M in profit within the first 2 years, which would be a forward-looking 4X profit multiple.  Future  - I will continue running Small Bets myself as its own autonomous subsidiary. Basically, nothing changes. I still decide what happens there. Of course, that could change in the future but Small Bets has had 41 consecutive cash-flow positive months, and if that performance continues I see no reason for me getting kicked out.  - Payment processing is likely becoming a race to the bottom, almost a commodity nowadays. Gumroad wants to be doing more than just payments to remain a valuable business.  - The goal is to eventually turn Gumroad into a community rather than just a payment processor, where new and aspiring entrepreneurs get help starting and succeeding with whatever they want to do, even if it doesn’t involve using Gumroad’s products. The plan is still fuzzy, but that’s the direction. Small Bets will act as a laboratory for these ideas.  - Small Bets has already shown the value of a support network and how having people with first-hand experience in your corner can help beyond what any AI or piece of software can. We will try to scale this concept further so that Gumroad can help creators with much more than just payments.  - And if you’re one of the 6,692 lifetime members of the Small Bets community, thank you so much for trusting me and supporting my project.

2025-04-15	✨ So @copylinekiller managed to track a Reddit hater down  And we contacted him and asked how we could help him  It turns out he's a highly skilled young software dev (and I think also designer cause his stuff looks great) from Norway and looking for work because he's a bit stuck career wise  And he's actually a really nice person too  I told him to make an X account, he had one but inactive, but now he uses it so he's now on here @hugolgst, please give him a follow if you can!   I helped him set a profile photo, write bio etc. and I told him to make a portfolio website which he very quickly did (see video, I'll put link in reply). Again this guy seems VERY competent and fast. He made a very cool Northern Lights browser (also in video at end).   He just needs a bit of a push to get out of his difficult work situation  I think leaving Norway would be great for him too but I'm biased, I think sunny (and affordable!) places are better to live. But for that he'd need a remote job first  His stack is TypeScript, Golang, Ruby, Python, Nix, Git, Docker but then again who cares about that, good devs can learn anything really  If you can help him in any way, please do 😊  X can do magical miracles sometimes so here's his shot! ❤️

2025-04-15	I agree with all of this except set an alarm  I'd say never set an alarm  One of the reasons I still look relatively young is 100% because I was able to stop using an alarm about 12 years ago after graduating uni I think  My dad's a cardiologist and alarms cause a giant jump in blood pressure  Instant jolt of stress and cortisol, also it cuts off your sleep  You should awake naturally when your body had enough sleep  Of course life gets in the way, but being a business owner, you can set your own times and awake when you're fully rested  Harder with kids but must be possible too
2025-04-15	men over 25, follow these simple rules and you will be in the top 1%  (no supplements required)  - set your alarm and wake up at that time every day  - walk in the sunlight every morning  - no processed foods ever  - no alcohol ever - 30 minutes of vigorous activity every single day  - lift weights 3x a week minimum - plan and track what you eat  - drink a gallon of water daily  - no caffeine after 2pm - go to bed by 11pm   simple as that  everything else is noise and marketing
2025-04-15	And coffee for me not after 6pm personally  I've tested a lot and seems to only affect me after that

2025-04-15	Kling's new video model came out today  I think we can finally say AI video is "good enough" for basic purposes like YouTube videos etc  It's hard to notice it's AI for most people  Which means the next frontier isn't quality but it's cost because it's still too expensive to generate AI videos now, like $0.50-$2.50 for 5 seconds  Once we'll see cost dropping to $0.05 per second and then everyone will be using this to make YouTube videos etc  Especially good already for documentary-style YouTubers who need lots of B-rolls
2025-02-23	Tried Google's new AI video model Veo 2 today on @FAL   It has image2video which makes it VERY useful for Photo AI  It's about 5-10x more expensive at $2.50 to $5 per video than all the competing video models (like Hailuo and Kling)  But from first look it does look to be superior  Esp the first few seconds here are just absolutely great and passable, then it loses resemblance quick (the prison bars do not help for continuity either)  This is from an AI photo from Photo AI into a video  Very exciting times!

2025-04-13	RT @alexhorner2002: A terrible pizza place I was at reported my review for defamation. Google deleted it ofc. To appeal I had to send proof that I was there and what i wrote was true, with timestamps and everything. Luckily I actually had that by pure chance because I made a reservation online and took a few pictures that day. Funnily enough the restaurant sent an email begging for a Google review after my visit, so that’s what i used as proof that i was there.  Even with all that prof it took a lot of back and forth with Google to get it reinstated.  Was a lot of work, and the email even said I might have to defend the review in court. I really doubt even 1/10 reported reviews go through all that effort and risk.

2025-04-13	This is so true  Also most luxury hotels remind me of my grandma's house  Everything looks so grotesquely out of date  Pretty much only in Asia they look really modern with nice design, I'll show you in the next tweet https://t.co/vdgB6QHpNH
2025-04-13	It amazes me that you can spend up to 5 grand a night at some extremely high end Aman/Bulgari/FourSeasons/Ritzy hotel and there are still 2 guarantees if you order a latte:   1. It's coming in some awful fucking glass.  2. It's going to be absolutely shit.
2025-04-13	I prefer this style of luxury hotels in Asia  These are Capella and Kimpton Maa-Lai in Bangkok  Less elements, less colors, more bright, less grandma, more young, more minimalist  If you order a latte there you'd get it in a cup like Starbucks, not the weird European bs glass https://t.co/sIy8lzz8iq

2025-04-13	I think it just happens organically  You can't really influence it as a government with some program where you spend $100K on building a free coworking and inviting a few foreigners and calling something "Nomad City" or "Nomad Island" (I've seen this a lot)  It doesn't work, well it works for a few months, then everybody leaves again  Only way you can attract foreigners is the same how you just generally create a great place:  Make it safe, affordable, easy to do business, easy to do gov stuff etc. add easy visas, residence, taxes for them  Also gotta make sure your locals are actually happy, or they'll just get angry seeing DNs get benefits and then protest/attack them
2025-04-13	@levelsio Not even sure if you’ll see this message but, as someone actively in the process of consulting with various governments regarding how they can attract digital nomads, I’m curious to know what you think the key ingredients are for making a place a digital nomad magnet?

2025-04-13	@levelsio In Germany you can buy a reviews removal service:  A lawyer sends customers an email claiming they never been to the place, remove it now or we’ll sue you.

2025-04-12	It's a real thing and every business owner does it in 2025  That's why every rating you see everywhere converges around 4.7 out of 5 stars now
2025-04-12	@levelsio I had a tax accountant, who recieved weekly 1 star reviews but her overall rating was 5 stars because she got the reviews removed. Her service was criminally bad. And I relied on the reviews when making the contract with her.  This is a HUGE Problem overall. Thanks for fixing
2025-04-12	The last few years Google Maps lets business owners delete reviews  This means you can't trust any ratings on Google Maps anymore  Everything is a 4.7 now  I'm building Hotel List to fix that for hotels first, no fake reviews and ratings, no pay-to-play bullshit  It normalizes ratings so that for ex if Google Maps generally ranges from 3-5 stars, the real range is not 0-5 but 3-5! See img
2025-04-12	@levelsio I’ve had many bad experiences in well rated places lately, maybe something changed in their policy
2025-04-12	Consensus about rating is nice to figure out if there's fake reviews/ratings  Most hotels/restaurants fake them on specific platforms, they can't fake them consistently on ALL platforms  Meaning it's a good way to figure out if a place is actually good or not
2025-04-12	@grok is this true and explain the problem

2025-04-12	🤖 My cute referral robot is working well now  Every day it checks who referred someone and then adds 1000 credits to both their accounts  I monitor it a bit for abuse but not seeing any yet  Way way way way more easy than an affiliate program where you have to do manual payouts on Wise and then 60% don't arrive and then you get angry comments "Pieter Levels doesn't pay out his affiliates" stuff  This system is entirely internal and self-sufficient, very simple
2025-02-11	First one to do:  [ 🤝 Refer a friend ] feature  The person they refer will get 1000 free photo credits and they too  Before I had a paid affiliate program but the payouts were such a hassle so I already like this much more 😊  This is a JavaScript popup with prompt() again btw :D
2025-04-12	P.S. when I had the affiliate program with @getRewardful, they were GREAT the whole time  But I'd only consider going back to affiliate payouts if they change their service into 100% dealing with payouts and I don't have to do that job  It's too annoying for me, too much work

2025-04-12	So when Google launched in early 2000s  It was cool because it was super minimalist  Unlike the Yahoo and AltaVista's of then that were filled with news and bs, it was just a search bar  It even had a [ I'm feeling lucky ] button which would send you straight to the first result  So this just shows a Google completely gone from its original roots of cool deep tech and high quality user experience

2025-04-11	✨ Neglected this project for 6 months but I'm back on it  Hotel List . com tries to remove the bullshit from hotel booking sites like fake ratings, and paid listings. Many of the top listed hotels on booking sites now are there because they agree to give the booking site higher commission. The more hotels pay, the higher up they get. The entire thing is rigged!  The idea is by @lexfridman because he asked me on his podcast why hotel booking sites are so shit, so I've started making it then  Hotel List aggregates lots of sites ratings and reviews, then more importantly it uses AI to figure out if the hotel is actually good: it checks the hotel's photos, videos and reads reviews on Reddit  I've been using it myself to find the best hotels for awhile now and it's a better experience than booking sites already  I've also managed to get Hotelist . com (without the double L), so renaming it to that also I think!
2024-10-11	Added frontpage cache, API cache, and hotel page modal cache now with Cloudflare to   https://t.co/C6eGxzwSb8  Also stripped all the code that was dependent on Nomad List  So now everything should be fast!  Still an alpha version though while I improve it :D https://t.co/dKCjn0XCXR

2025-04-11	One of the funniest meetup stories I had  I organized a Nomad List meetup in in 2015, also in Medellin, at a bar called Burdo  I entered and joined the group already sitting there, I ordered drinks and we talked for about half an hour about life and travel etc.  Then I mentioned "yeah I met other digital nomads from Nomad List at this other meetup"  And they said "Nomad List?"   I said "yes like this meetup"  And they said  "meetup?"  I said "this isn't the Nomad List meetup?"  They said "no we're just friends who met up in a bar"  I said "so why am I here?"  They said "cause you just sat down with us and started talking"  I look up and I see a group of more mixed looking people and walk up there and that was the actual meetup 😂😂😂

2025-04-10	✨ Yesterday we had a VERY special guest at the 9th edition of the Weekly Coworking in my house  @karpathy dropped by!!!  It's an extreme honor to meet one of the greatest minds of AI. I make little AI startups, but a lot of the technology I use, he was involved and foundational in and my stuff exists because of people like him  So I made him my specialty V60 coffee with the best freshly ground 🇧🇷☕️ Brazil beans :D there was no time for 🥩 local steak but maybe next time!  Then we worked a bit, he judged the top 50 games for the #vibejam as he's part of the jury (and inventor of the word "vibe coding")  And then we walked around to show him our little surf beach town in Portugal, the weather was great and sunny so that helped  He noticed how Portugal looks oddly similar to the Bay Area, I mean Lisbon literally has the Golden Gate Bridge, it has the trams from San Francisco, and then walking in our beach town you see the cliffs and fog in the distance, exactly as you see them in California too. And the mild climate and even the color of the sunsets are super similar  Crazily enough he told me he was a Nomad List member from when it started 10 years ago, because he wanted to go digital nomad then!  What's cool about @karpathy that he seems to be in a sweet spot of being a high level engineer but with a very creative side to it. He seems very interested in seeing AI used by as many people as possible in creative ways.  And that's also kinda what he's working on next with @EurekaLabsAI building a school where AI is heavily integrated as a way to teach billions of students in the future  A very fun day and I wonder who will be the next special guest for our weekly coworking day, maybe this can become a thing  You can just start a weekly coworking in your house and people will start showing up! ☺️☺️☺️

2025-04-10	Genius!
2025-04-10	A common pattern in consumer AI over the last couple years:  An app that generates AI portraits of you will go viral—but then users churn after a few days. I started advising one of these apps last year called @vybeappp  and the goal was to turn it into a durable app.  We started with this question: In what context would people need generative portraits on a recurring basis?  The founder @mandelapatrick_ dug into the data and found that some users were sticking around: they were trying on different clothes using the app.  So we redesigned the app to be exclusively focused on this use-case. But most importantly, we integrated it into their existing patterns of behavior: a mobile safari extension that would intercept the user every time they were shopping. Just tap a button to try on the item on any page.  They just shipped it and the results blew past all expectations: Retention nearly 4x. Once the user enabled the extension, they were essentially retained for life.  And even better, it unlocked a better revenue stream: instead of a subscription that users would inevitably cancel, VYBE simply collects a commission in the background off every purchase into perpetuity.

2025-04-09	Most founders think VC-backed means rich, but bootstrapped means poor.  Not true. I’ve done both:  VC exits are rare: most are small, and only a tiny few are big. Founders are diluted to 10%, locked for years with an earnout.  Bootstrapping to $3.7M/y at 80% margin equals $3M/y in profits, which is $30M/10y. But the VC path means hoping for a big exit after years. I raised pre-seed to Series A 10+ times and stayed poor, dreaming of billions that never came. I knew 1000+ founders, but only 1 hit life-changing money.  My profits fund whatever I want today, not in some imaginary future.

2025-04-08	Marketing AI agents will be much harder to build by humans, let alone by other AI agents.  I get why AI coding works - it’s logical. All elements are known, AI just connects the dots. Pattern recognition is where it’s good at.  But automating persuasion at scale? I’m skeptical.  Optimizing ads, automating tasks, tweaking copy? Sure.   But “give me 15% more leads”? Doubt it.  Persuading people is hard. You’re competing with everyone. And they have AI too.  AI marketing feels like asking AI to “make 15% in the stock market today.” If that worked, we'd all be rich.

2025-04-07	I think you are misunderstanding what this tech demo actually is, but I will engage with what I think  your gripe is — AI tooling trivializing the skillsets of programmers, artists, and designers.  My first games involved hand assembling machine code and turning graph paper characters into hex digits.  Software progress has made that work as irrelevant as chariot wheel maintenance.  Building power tools is central to all the progress in computers.  Game engines have radically expanded the range of people involved in game dev, even as they deemphasized the importance of much of my beloved system engineering.  AI tools will allow the best to reach even greater heights, while enabling smaller teams to accomplish more, and  bring in some completely new creator demographics.  Yes, we will get to a world where you can get an interactive game (or novel, or movie) out of a prompt, but there will be far better exemplars of the medium still created by dedicated teams of passionate developers.  The world will be vastly wealthier in terms of the content available at any given cost.  Will there be more or less game developer jobs? That is an open question. It could go the way of farming, where labor saving technology allow a tiny fraction of the previous workforce to satisfy everyone, or it could be like social media, where creative entrepreneurship has flourished at many different scales. Regardless, “don’t use power tools because they take people’s jobs” is not a winning strategy.

The European Commission plans to present a proposal to cut back the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR for short, in the next couple of weeks. Slashing regulation is a key focus for Commission President @vonderleyen, as part of an attempt to make businesses in Europe more competitive with rivals in the United States, China and elsewhere.   🇪🇺 👏

2025-04-06	RT @patrickc: Having now spent about half my life in each (and loving both), herewith the pros and cons of Europe and the US in everyday life:  Better in Europe • Bike lanes and bike infrastructure. London, Paris, and Amsterdam are all excellent these days. (As are many other European cities.) Made even better by easy-to-rent e-bikes—now almost always the fastest way to get around. • The urban walking experience generally. Partly for density reasons, and partly because of... • Late-night cafe, brasserie culture. Is there an economic reason for this or is it just climate and contingent zoning? • Architecture. Around 1920, we forgot how to make nice buildings. European cities tend to have more construction from before the Great Forgetting, and it makes the built environment much more pleasant. • Pedestrianized streets. Often with cobblestones. • In general, European cities are just more pleasant. Given how hard it is to build a good city (or indeed to retrofit one), this feels like a big deal. • Cured and pickled food. • Bread. Obviously varies by country, but it’s generally true. • Voltage. What are Americans doing waiting so long to boil kettles? • Beauty in the mundane. I find that you’re more likely to find tasteful touches in prosaic places in Europe. • Motorway design and signage. Standardized, clear, and easy-to-use. The US is a mess by comparison. • Bathroom doors. That is, in Europe, they’re proper doors. Why does America make us see others’ feet? • The clangor of church bells on Sunday. • Trains. Enough said. • Pharmacies. I'd love to understand why they're so much nicer in Europe. • Cheese. Again, lots of cross-country variation, but true in general. • I'm not sure why, but European regulation on many everyday items seems better. Sunscreens in Europe are better, as are bike helmets. • Wine. • Languor, joie de vivre, hygge, gemütlichkeit, craic. I think Europeans are better at unwinding. Drawing contrast with what he found in the US, De Tocqueville observed that in Europe "idleness is still held in honor". This difference remains apparent. • Road density. Europe generally has many more roads per square mile, which makes it easier to find nice places to run, walk, and cycle.  Better in the US • Air conditioning. Consistently bad in Europe. (Partly for silly degrowth-related reasons?) • Coffee. Opinions will differ, naturally, but third wave coffee has seen much more enthusiastic adoption in the US. • Cookie banners. That is, the lack of them. (Well, there are some, but it’s not as bad as the fusillade one is subjected to in Europe.) • Internet speeds. European wifi often reminds me of my dialup youth. • Capital markets. If you need money (as a consumer, a small business, or a startup), it’s much easier to get it in the US. • Being able to buy groceries on Sunday. Inexplicably challenging on the continent. • Showers. Like the tepid air conditioning, daily ablutions in Europe are conducted beneath parsimonious trickles. • Urban air quality. Maybe surprisingly, it is, on average, better in the US. The unpleasant whiffs of diesel exhaust is part of the reminder that one is back in Europe. • Government efficiency. In general, things happen faster in the US. • Labor laws. As covered in Stripe's annual letter this year, people are more likely to work in high productivity sectors in the US (and thus to earn more). Rigid rules impede this reallocation in Europe. • Culture of general aviation with many thousands of small airports. There are around 700,000 pilots in the US—far more than there are in Europe. • Hospitals. A controversial claim, perhaps, but I find that those who have received care in Europe and the US prefer the US. • Beer. The microbrewery revolution of the US means that it’s clearly the better place for it.

2025-04-06	RT @tynan: Some thoughts on the tariffs from a guy whose only real qualifications are that I'm pretty non-partisan and a critical thinker.  I don't know if the tariffs are a good idea or not, and I don't think that anyone else really knows either. The global economy is such a complex organism that anyone who is saying for sure whether they're good or not is really just speculating.  However... it feels obvious to me that the US was on an unsustainable financial path and something needs to be done. Whether I agree with Trump in general or not, I appreciate that he is at least identifying that there is a problem and is willing to to try something new to address it. I also appreciate that he is willing to say what no other politician is ever willing to say: "We may have to take some short term pain for some long term gain". I'd like to hear more politicians say that on both sides of the aisle, because that's very often the path to good results. Pretending that we can always have everything we want without ever paying for it is unsustainable.  As many others have pointed out, it does seem like the tariffs were not exactly calculated with as much consideration as they should have been. I think that's a fair criticism. You read about chaos for US importers having to adjust daily to new tariffs, and that also feels like a mistake.  The stock market has gone down, but I'm not convinced that's a bad thing. Nearly every pundit thought that PE values were too high (though they kept buying anyway), and it seemed likely that something was going to have to give at some point. I also find a bit of humor in the fact that a common criticism of Trump's cabinet and Elon was that they were all going to grift and enrich themselves. It's too early to tell if that's true or not, but as a group their net worths have gone down more than most, I imagine. And we don't see people posting Elon's net worth change since inauguration day like they did when he was up.  Whenever people are hysterical about any change being made, I always ask: "was the previous situation exactly correct?". Did we have the exact correct tariffs before? Were they too high before? Were they too low? Would we have been upset about any change at all just because we have to be angry at the other team? Instinctively it feels wrong allowing other countries to tariff us at much higher rates than we do it. The best counter to this point is that we export IP and services which aren't tariffed, so imbalanced tariffs may make sense. At the same time, I have little sympathy when a country is outraged that we're doing to them what they do to us.  I think Trump has two goals: lower interest rates to allow the US to save many billions when refinancing our debt, and lower interest rates so that mortgages and capital are cheaper. These are good goals, though of course you could argue that the price we're paying is too steep. The yield rates are already dropping, so he has at least begun to succeed on that front. His other goal is to invent a bargaining chip that he can use when renegotiating trade and security deals that he feels are unfair (and probably are, at least to some extent).  Will it all work? I don't know. It's a risk and we're facing the negative consequences of it now without knowing whether or not there will be a payoff. I've lost a lot on paper because of these moves, but I'm still happy we're trying them and are willing as a nation to take short term pain in search of long term gain. I would have also been happy if Obama had managed to get us to try socialized health care or if @AndrewYang had been elected and we tried UBI. For our nation to be at its best we should try new ideas, give them time to be realized, and decide based on the data whether to stay the course or not.  When our leadership changes they always quietly keep the things that worked (even if they were against it at the time) and then loudly get rid of the things that didn't. I wish we could be a little more graceful about it, but I think that's a big strength of our system.  And if I can make a prediction just for fun: I'd guess that interest rates will indeed go down, most of the tariffs will eventually be rolled back after exacting some concessions, and that no one will be talking about tariffs in a year. I also think that barring any covid-like disaster, the market will fully recover and will be in good shape in 1-2 years, as if this never happened.

For our nation to be at its best we should try new ideas, give them time to be realized, and decide based on the data whether to stay the course or not.  When our leadership changes they always quietly keep the things that worked (even if they were against it at the time) and then loudly get rid of the things that didn't. I wish we could be a little more graceful about it, but I think that's a big strength of our system.  And if I can make a prediction just for fun: I'd guess that interest rates will indeed go down, most of the tariffs will eventually be rolled back after exacting some concessions, and that no one will be talking about tariffs in a year. I also think that barring any covid-like disaster, the market will fully recover and will be in good shape in 1-2 years, as if this never happened.

2025-04-05	This is insane and makes it finally possibly to vibe code up to giant code sizes  The limit just weeks ago was context window, AI would get lost once your vibe coded game or app became too big  Imagine an AI with memory loss, it starts breaking stuff  With 10M tokens there's practically no limit  Really quite big for vibe coding and another big hit for the perpetual naysayers!

2025-04-05	This only works if you don't live in America where there exists such an angelic thing named Cinnabon  I'm a man of meat and vegetables but when I smell the cinnamon they blast out of Cinnabon stores I get taken over and enter to buy the freshly made juicy warm succulent Cinnabons https://t.co/Lbk8cPHQFt
2025-04-05	Greatness comes from saying "no" to impulsive desires.  - I wanted to check my phone when I woke up, but I didn't. - I wanted to skip the daily workout, but I didn't. - I wanted the cinnamon roll at the coffee shop, but I didn't. - I wanted to watch YouTube while coding, but I didn't.  Tonight, I'm going to bed healthier, happier, and more fulfilled than yesterday because I didn't let my monkey brain hijack me.

2025-04-04	I was inspired after reading @Skrillex post on this  He was lead singer for a big punk band and he'd always be on the road touring  He had a laptop though and would try make electronic music with that for fun in the tour bus  He had no keyboard, speakers, mixers etc. Just a laptop and he'd draw the notes in with the trackpad. He made the songs that made him break through on that ~2010 I think  That taught me that I too probably only need just a MacBook Pro and no accessories and screens etc. If Skrillex can do it
2025-04-04	@levelsio i also notice over the years that the less peripherals i have the less things i have to get distracted about, so i’ve found the best setup for me is max 1 extra monitor and airpods, no mouse or external keyboard, I always just use the trackpad and keyboard of the laptop

2025-04-04	✨ Day 2 of judging the 2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam sponsored by @boltdotnew + @coderabbitai  Me and @s13k_ have now rated 500 games with 1 to 5 stars (250 games each)  Again lots of amazing and crazy games here today  I learnt that games can be very simple yet very cool and effective and fun  Now we're left with a top 50 of games that will soon be presented to - @karpathy (inventor of the term Vibe Coding) - @timsoret (famous professional game dev) - @mrdoob (creator of ThreeJS)  Who will then give their 5 star ratings  Then I think we'll have the FINAL results by mid next week!  🏆 First prize: $10,000 🏅 Second prize: $5,000 🎖️ Third prize: $2,500  Great work everyone 😍
2025-04-03	✨ May the judging of the 2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam sponsored by @boltdotnew + @coderabbitai now commence...  Me and the amazing @s13k_ have pre-vetted the 1000+ games now hand by hand and cut it down to about 500 games left based on rules (many games didn't even load for ex)  (actually @s13k_ did a lot more because he's way faster than me!)  ⭐️ Now we are giving those 1-5 star ratings, and we rate 250 games each  We will then take the top 50 by rating from the list and present those games to @karpathy + @timsoret + @mrdoob   The ratings of the top 50 games by them and me and @s13k_ will then be summed up and we'll present the winners  I think can be done by next week!  🏆 First prize is $10,000 🏅 Second prize is $5,000 🎖️ Third prize is $2,500  There's just very cool original and weird games in here I love it, I see a lot of effort went into these and the range of different types of games is amazing to see  You all did a great job and should be proud of yourself ❤️

2025-04-04	📈 Fixed Nomads's chart view  It was broken for a while because I cached all filter data with a key based on the filtering + sort, but that key didn't include the chart X and Y values so it'd end up loading a cache without the X and Y value it requested  Now fixed so you can do fun chart analysis like IQ level vs average annual temperature  Obviously: the colder the higher IQ (thanks AC!) 😊

2025-04-04	✨ ChatGPT is getting better with images  So Photo AI has to rapidly get better too  I've been testing with increasing the resolution of Flux generating to much higher for a while now and it seems to work well and image generation time is not much longer  I've called it [ Flux HD ] and it's live now for all Premium and Ultra subscribers
2025-04-03	✨ New mini feature that helps you write prompts today that I got the idea from getimg .ai, an [ AI Improve ] button under the prompt box  It takes your prompt, expands and improves it and adds detail  One of ChatGPT's strengths is you ask it to make an image but it turns it into a really great big image prompt for its image model  A detailed prompt gets better image results than a simple prompt generally:  "model with green hair in magical forest"   ->  "a male model with striking green hair stands amidst a magical forest, where the canopy is alive with luminescent foliage. the sunlight filters through the mist, casting ethereal beams of light that dance upon the moss-covered ground. his hair appears to blend seamlessly with the vibrant emerald shades around him, almost glowing with its own mystical energy. the model wears an intricately detailed outfit that mirrors the forest's hues, adorned with delicate vines and leaves. in the background, the forest is alive with enchanted creatures fluttering about, their eyes luminescent and curious. the atmosphere is serene and otherworldly, evoking a sense of wonder and enchantment. the scene is captured with a high level of detail and a soft focus around the edges, enhancing the dreamlike quality."

2025-04-03	Former Apple employee, left because there is zero focus on making a good product and 100% focus on politics and value extraction from the company.  Extremely difficult to get fired results in a many people literally just hanging out and collecting checks.  If you start to actually get something done they throw things in your way to slow you down and stop you so they don’t look bad.  It will rot from the inside out
