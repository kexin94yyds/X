2024-12-31	If you want 2025 to be the best year of your life, please watch this video. https://t.co/8BP7pTEIXl
2024-12-31	First time founder: “You need to sign an NDA before I tell you my idea.”  Second time founder: “Here’s everything I’ve got. No one’s gonna care until I make it happen anyways. And it’ll take money, years, and probably won’t work the way we expect.”
2024-12-30	At some point everyone needs to choose whether they’d rather risk rejection now or guarantee regret later.
2024-12-30	“He who fears that he shall suffer shall always suffer from what he fears.” - Michel de Montaigne  Woof.
2024-12-30	Beginners automate to save money. Professionals automate to save effort. Masters automate to save time.
2024-12-30	Every person at some point in their lives needs to decide whether they’re more afraid of failing through action or failing through inaction.  You’re gonna fail either way, but only one of them gets you closer to your goal.
2024-12-29	Pro tip for goal writing season:  Next to each goal, write down what you’re willing to give up to get it.  You can’t add hours to your day, so you have to start by making room for the things that matter by removing the things that don’t.
2024-12-29	Every entrepreneur needs a mile long fuse for figuring sh*t out and a hair trigger for taking action once you do.
2024-12-29	How to guarantee failure:  Let other peoples opinions determine your priorities.
2024-12-29	A lot of success comes down to sticking with something long enough to make the number of mistakes required to actually figure it out.  Otherwise, you just keep starting from zero every month.
2024-12-29	Financial freedom spelled out w US Nat’l avgs:   1) Pay off house in cash $357k 2) Pay off car in cash $25k 3) Home insurance $217/mo 4) Car insurance $148/mo 5) Property Tax $300/mo (1%)  Save $382k for 🏠 🚗  Invest $105k @ 5% for ins + tax.  TLDR: $487k &amp; lifestyle is up to u.
2024-12-29	The rest is entirely up to your lifestyle. If you want US median income, you need another $1.2M invested earning  5% to make $60k tax free (gov bonds).   So total “0 risk” passive living is somewhere in the $1.6M-2M range. Doable with some intelligence &amp; discipline &amp; patience.
2024-12-28	The biggest misconception I had when starting a business was that I would somehow “know enough” to be ready.   You never will. You have to learn how to operate off incomplete information - with conviction. Start. Then adjust as you learn more. That’s it.
2024-12-27	People say “do or die” like it’s a choice. Reality is you’re going to die either way.  So you might as well do something cool before you do. And if you don’t, the only person who loses out is you.
2024-12-27	If people worked for their goals as hard as they envy others for achieving them, they’d have them already.

2024-12-27	Most crazy goals become realistic if you think about accomplishing them over ten years rather than one.  Your goal isn’t crazy, just your timeline.
2024-12-27	The simplest way to live the life you want is to decide what that is, and say no to everything that isn’t that.  Simple not easy.
2024-12-27	Personal growth doesn’t happen on good days, it happens between them.
2024-12-25	A year from now you’re not going to care what anyone thought about you when your debt is paid, you’re back to your goal weight, and you started that thing you always said you would.
2024-12-25	An error in personal branding is if you reflect yourself in a way that you aren’t, not if you accurately reflect who you are and people don’t like it.
2024-12-25	Richer people wont judge you for saving your money.  Fitter people wont judge you for cutting your calories.  Higher status people wont judge you for cutting bad friends.  It’s the people going nowhere who have the most to say because they have nothing to do.
2024-12-25	The fastest way to become the person you want to be is to put yourself in a situation where you have no choice but to become them.
2024-12-24	Stolen from @LeilaHormozi :   “People aren’t good or bad. They’re good and bad.”
2024-12-24	When you start a business, that discomfort, the pervasive uncertainty—that “hard” is not some complicated thing. It’s unending people, problems, mistakes, and feeling like you have no idea.  But here’s the thing: the only way businesses die is entrepreneurs give up. So just dont.
2024-12-23	I dressed up and went on vacation.  Anything is possible.
2024-12-22	Happy Holidays 🩷 https://t.co/xl5FkFNzs5
2024-12-22	Imagine a random person in the 1700s comes to the future just to ask you if they should upset their loved ones, take a chance, and pursue their dreams.  You’d probably say “I’ve never heard of you, or the people whose opinions you care about. No one is gonna have heard of you in the future. So you might as well live the life you want.” And you’d send them happily on their way.  We are that random person. And 300 years from now our struggles will appear the same. Very important to us - and also - irrelevant.
2024-12-21	Immigrant parenting 101  Child: I got an A+ see? They said I exceeded expectations   Parent: Well, exceeding expectations is my expectation of you. So you only met expectations. And only meeting expectations is below my expectations.  Child: *sighs* - I’ll do better next time.
2024-12-22	To be clear to anyone who doesn’t to be clear  to anyone who doesn’t know me - I saw this as a humor post.   Parents can raise their kids however they want.  Immigrant parents tend to do a better job than normal.  I’m grateful for my upbringing. 0 complaints.
2024-12-21	Everything you want is on the other side of a few hard conversations you’ve been putting off.  I’ve never regretted having a hard conversation—only how long it took me to have it.
2024-12-21	If you’re gonna do it next year, you might as well start now and start enjoying the benefits sooner.  And if the benefits aren’t good enough to do it now, they’re not gonna be any better in the future.  So either change the goal or change yourself.
2024-12-21	You’ll never beat anyone except in your own mind because they’ll either:  1) Forget you exist  2) Change the rules to favor themselves.   If you win financially, they’ll say they have a better spouse.  If you have a better spouse, they’ll say they’re healthier.  If you’re healthier, they’ll say they’re happier.  If you’re happier, they’ll say they’re morally superior to you.  It doesn’t matter what you do, people will change the narrative to make themselves the hero.
2024-12-21	Being kind only counts when it’s to people you don’t want to be kind to.
2024-12-20	Friendly reminder that your competitors have bad sales days, ad campaigns that bomb, and employees who don’t pull their weight.   They don’t know what they’re doing either.  You’ll be fine. Just focus on the problem in front of you and take it one day at a time.
2024-12-20	Winning leads to leveling up. Leveling up leads to harder opponents. Harder opponents leads to losing. Losing leads to learning. Learning leads to winning.  Just depends what part of the cycle you’re in.

2024-12-19	No one gets to the end of their life and says: I’m glad I did what everyone else wanted me to.  Sometimes your own approval needs to be enough.
2024-12-19	My business Xmas list:  -top tier talent magically finding us -ad platforms charging us less -vendors delivering on time -no supply chain shortages -interest rates dropping -customers taking all upsells -customers bringing their friends -jumbo email open rates  What’s your list?
2024-12-19	As long as the people who know you like you better than the people who don’t, you’re on the right track.
2024-12-18	One of my favorite quotes.  And so very true.
2024-12-18	Buying people food/dessert subscriptions for Christmas is a nice idea.  They think about you 12x per year positively rather than once.
2024-12-18	Business sucks a lot of the time. And I wish I could say you get used to it. But you don’t. You just unlock new levels of suck.  The only thing that makes the hardship of business worse is the expectation that it should be easy.
2024-12-17	Friendly reminder:  The people whose opinions are stopping you from doing what you want are going to die.  And if their opinion is going to be forgotten eventually, you might as well forget about it today.
2024-12-16	It’s better to be hated for the truth than loved for a lie.
2024-12-16	Don’t give up your goals for a girl (or guy).   Find one that helps you go after them.
